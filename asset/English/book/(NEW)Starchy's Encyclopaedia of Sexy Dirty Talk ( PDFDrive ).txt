STARCHY’S ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF SEXY

DIRTY TALK v3

Dirty talk is a hugely important means of turning on a woman, enhancing her orgasms and connection to you.

As David Shade says,

 “Women don’t want to be seen as sluts, but in the context of sexual intimacy with the man they trust, they love to be slutty”

 “In The Context Of Heightened Sexual Arousal EVERYTHING Change

 “I cannot tell you how very important and how powerful this is. Your most powerful tool in the bedroom is not your tool, it is your voice. It is by far the most powerful tool”

The Secrets of Female Sexuality

Pdf

The Dark Secret Of Women

Women live a life of dichotomies. They need dichotomy in their lives.

During the day, she is that proper educated professional woman with a career. But at night, in the bedroom, she wants to express her sexuality like a slut. (Without being a slut. Big difference.) During the day, she wants to be in control of her life and her destiny. But at night, in the bedroom, she wants to be submissive and told what she will do sexually.

A woman wants to be known by most of the people in her life as being innocent. But with her man, she wants to be naughty.

On Sunday mornings, she teaches Sunday school. On Saturday nights, she is slutty.

Certainly, every woman is different. Each woman has preferences, norms, and extremes unique to her.

A woman is attracted to the dichotomy in her man. Her man must be sensitive, yet strong. Caring, yet dominant.

Sweet, yet able to tell her what she will do sexually.

A woman is attracted to a man who is serious and focused about his career during the day, but at night can be light hearted and people oriented.

A woman is attracted to a man who is confident (Not cocky. Big difference) but who also does not take himself too seriously. With the right man, a woman can allow herself to act dirty. (Without being dirty. Big difference.) In the living room, a woman expects her man to use proper anatomical terms, like penis and vagina. In the bedroom, she expects him to use slang terms, like cock and pussy. If he uses slang in the living room, she sees him as inappropriate. If he uses proper terms in the bedroom, she just laughs.

When a woman feels secure, cared about, and special, then she can be turned on about being someone's horny bitch. She can be turned on about being fucked doggy up the ass while having her hair pulled and ass slapped. She can be turned on about watching her man fuck another woman. She can be turned on about being double penetrated by her man and his buddy.

All of the above assumes a mentally healthy woman with a good sense of deservedness. It is true that there are mentally screwed up women with a bad sense of deservedness, and practicing the above is more of an affirmation to her, rather than a healthy expression of her sexuality. (Very big difference.) And another thing... Some men blame society, or religion, or strict upbringings, for repressing female sexual expressiveness. We know very well that women don't want to be sluts, but the reality is that they get slutty for us all the time. We hear women say they would never do a one night stand, but the reality is that they do it anyway!

Pg 15





Society does not impose anything upon women, at least in Western cultures. Women choose it that way themselves. Women are social creatures. They want all that social establishments have to offer. If there weren't a societal structure, women would create one.

Women are social creatures. They prefer it that way. They want to know if the man is a social creature. They want to know if he can work within the social rules. They will run him through all their social tests, and when he passes, they fuck him silly. Simple really.

Women will continue to sustain the social norms and enjoy being on the arm of a proper gentleman, and women will continue to surrender to him when he fucks them hard like the very naughty sluts that they love to be. Stop worrying about society, or religion, or strict upbringings; instead, embrace the dichotomy of womankind.

The Dichotomies Of Women

Women don’t want to be seen as sluts, but in the context of sexual intimacy with the man they trust, they love to be slutty.

In her everyday life, a woman does not like to be told what to do. But in the context of sexuality with the man she trusts, she responds very powerfully to being told exactly what to do.

Women are repulsed when strange men send her pictures of their erect penis. But in the context of sexual intimacy, they find it a huge turn-on when their man gets an erection.

Women are repulsed when strange men masturbate while fantasizing about her. But she finds it very exciting when her man masturbates while fantasizing about her.

Women do not like it when men are possessive, relationship wise. But in the context of sexuality, she loves to be “owned.”

Women do not want to be objectified. But in the context of sexuality with her trusted lover, she loves to be treated like a piece of property.

Women are repulsed by the idea of being sexual with their father. But in the context of sexuality, she loves to call her lover “Daddy.”

In The Context Of Heightened Sexual Arousal EVERYTHING Changes

Dirty Talk

I cannot tell you how very important and how powerful this is. Your most powerful tool in the bedroom is not your tool; it is your voice. It is by far the most powerful tool.

A lot of men have trouble doing that. They are concerned that she will take it wrong, or that she will be offended or insulted, or that it would make her a slut.

Women don't want to be a slut, but they love to be slutty. In the right context, with her man that she trusts and respects, in privacy, under his care and direction and watchful eye, she loves to be slutty.

Start things slowly. Build the sexual arousal. Then begin introducing the dirty talk. Let the sexual arousal increase. Be sure to do it with absolute conviction. It must be believable.

As the sexual arousal increases, the context changes. Everything you say in heightened sexual arousal is taken in a completely different context. She will not take it wrong, because: Pg 16

Being Comfortable With Her Sexuality

Here’s another question:

You say that women want to be "slutty" in the bedroom and really "let go." I'm all for that! I really want to "be the man" and be in control and talk dirty to my girlfriend, but I hesitate and bungle it because I think she's going to take it wrong or be offended or feel like an object .I really want her to enjoy the sex and I really want to be good in the bedroom.

From your email, it is clear that you are already bought into the concept that she would enjoy it. You already understand that women respond powerfully to a man who is "in control." You already understand that it allows her to "let go" and get "slutty." All very true.

But even though you KNOW it's true and you are in complete logical agreement with the facts, you don't do it.

What a shame. You're missing out on all that is possible. And it's all because of your own hindering beliefs.

You think you would not be treating her with respect. You think it would be disrespectful.

As you recall, I talk at great length about respect. Everything can be measured against the word respect. But it has to be from the correct perspective.

Look at it this way...

In the living room, you treat her like a lady. Also said as: You treat her "with respect." All very good, and very important (at least for the high self esteem women.)

But in the bedroom, have RESPECT for the fact that she is a highly sexual creature that WANTS to get SLUTTY! Also very true (especially true for the high self esteem women.) RESPECT that about her. Have respect for her wishes.

Let me bring your attention to one phenomenon that will change your entire outlook on being "in control" in the bedroom:

During heightened sexual arousal

EVERYTHING you say is taken in a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT context

Live by those words.

What that means is that when she is feeling very sexual and highly aroused, things that may otherwise sound very disrespectful, will NOT be taken as disrespectful. In fact, they will actually INCREASE her excitement.

But you have to do it with absolute conviction. if you don't, the dirty talk will crash and burn.

To do it with absolute conviction, you have to be comfortable with the fact that she is a highly sexual creature.

And to be able to do that, you need to be comfortable with sexuality.

My transcript of the audio

Vol I, Issue 1 - The Art Of Sexy Dirty Talk

Track 02 - The Difference Between Dirty & Raunchy

DAVID SHADE :

Tonight we’re going to talk about the art of sexy dirty talk.

First let’s define promiscuous women and sensual women.

Promiscuous is a validation to make up for some void in her life, usually self-esteem. Many men interpret that as sexy, but many men are horny, not sexual.

But for a sensual woman she responds most powerfully to the mental aspects involved in sex. She requires a man who can make sex much more than the physical by incorporating mental. A man who can make it mentally stimulating.

Then let’s define physical sex and sexuality. Good looks and nice physique are great but only take a man so far.

If that is the only thing a man has to offer, a highly sexual woman will eventually tire of it. A truly sexual woman is the woman who incorporates her entire mind. She uses her imagination, she likes creativity, she likes playing and she likes roleplaying. She needs to feel powerful feelings as well as the sex. Actually for her, sex is only part of it. It is all the imagination and fantasy and creativity and mental aspects that makes the sex incredible for her.

It is important to learn sexy dirty talk because most women are sexually submissive. Almost all women at times are sexually submissive. It is in those times that she wants to get lost in it all and be lead through a sexual experience where the man assumes all responsibility for what happens.

This releases her from the need to initiate anything and the need to become a slut in order for her to have the experience. She wants to do slutty things and feel slutty without being a slut. His leading her through it gives her permission to feel this.

When he takes the initiative it is his responsibility and his ideas, so she goes along with it because he told her to and it just happens to be something she wants to do. But she would never initiate it herself because that would define her as a slut and is counter to her being submissive and at the same time her being told what to do is congruent to her being submissive.

Many men feel uncomfortable about talking dirty in the bedroom. That is because such men think she will take it wrong or that some men are not comfortable with being in control. A man needs to be comfortable with the fact that she is a sexual woman. A man needs to understand that anything he says in the context of heightened sexual arousal will be taken in a completely different context. That context is one of being in the moment, of her being lead through an experience, of her being sexually submissive and him taking the lead and responsibility.

The important context here is a sexual situation and of consensual sexual power exchange. He is leading and she is doing what she is told. When done properly she will respond powerfully to it.

If sexy dirty talk is new to a man he cannot let her know that. She will detect it and it will backfire. He must be totally congruent. Everything must be totally congruent with him being in charge. He must do everything with absolute conviction. He must be totally believable.

DAVID’S GIRLFRIEND :

Pg 18

Dirty talk is during sex is very important for most women. Once years ago I was dating a guy who had not yet initiated dirty talk in the bedroom. I really wanted him to talk dirty to me but I didn’t want to have to tell him to.

So one night while we were doing it, we were in the act, actually doggy style. I thought it would be the perfect opportunity. So I said to him “Oh yeah fuck your bitch”

He stopped cold and he said “You’re not a bitch”. It was an instant turnoff for me and I never called him again.

DAVID SHADE :

It is the man’s job to set it up such that she can be sexually excited. He need to setup the build-up. Once he builds it up, the sky is the limit. He can tell her to do anything and she will do it and especially because he tells her to do it. This is especially exciting for her. It is one of the many ways a woman pleases her man by demonstrating her responsiveness to him.

Track 03 - What Happens In The Bedroom

DAVID SHADE :

Now let’s talk about what happens in the bedroom.

First of all woman don’t usually initiate sex. She likes it when her man initiates it. But the intelligent sensual man sees signs she is giving out that she’s interested. Her not initiating sex does not mean she is not wanting it.

Again most women are sexually submissive. The intelligent sensual man does not ask for permission because that puts the responsibility into her hands which she doesn’t want.

The intelligent sensual man knows that his woman wants it. He also sets things up so that she will be interested.

Foreplay goes on all day.

To setup an interaction with her is to not seem like her man is in any kind of hurry. He’s not in a hurry to get off, it is not even important to him from her perspective. That is the number one thing that will differentiate him from all the horny guys. She needs to know that his main goal is not about getting off but it is about him, leading her into pleasure, she has never known.

Examples:

Light a candle and say to her, “Baby. Undress slowly for me so I can watch you undress.”

Say sexy things like, “I love to adore your body. You are beautiful to me.” All this time you are still completely dressed.

Whilst she is still standing, lightly touch her non-sexually. Then slam her against the wall and hold her hands above her head and make out with her. Then tell her to get on the bed.

Tell her how you adore the view of her on your bed.

Then say to her, “You are a sweet precious, innocent, beautiful thing”.

Then get close to her and make your voice deep and say, “But I KNOW, that really, you are my very naughty bad little bitch.”

This whole process is slow, each step takes time. Lead her through the experience of being completely vulnerable to you. Lead her into a place where she is totally naked to you in every way. Very powerful.

Go back and forth between sweet sexy & dirty. It’s like you’re trying to get the pussy. It’s about how you revel in all of it. She has to feel beautiful sexy and sensual but also slutty.

Pg 19

It is the shock of that dichotomy that makes it exciting for her and allows things to be lead into an even higher level. It is extremely erotic in the moment of the experience.

And then as you get undressed and get more sexual with her. Say things like,” Oh yeah, I love it when your nipples get hard.”

Then while you are touching her pussy say, “Oh yeah you are getting VERY wet. I KNOW you want it. You want to get FUCKED.”

And then while you are fucking her say to her, “Oh yeah baby you love it when I FUCK you. You are my very NAUGHTY little bitch and you love it when I FUCK you like the BITCH that you are.”

It is important that you first call her your bitch because then it puts it all into the context that it is about, her being slutty for you and not about her being a slut.

Then say, “Oh yeah baby you’re being very naughty, that makes you want to come. You want to come so FUCKING HARD.”

And right before she comes, say, “Oh yeah you’re being a very naughty little bitch. But I want you to show me how good you can come for me baby. COME LIKE A GOOD GIRL. COME FOR ME BABY GIRL.”

After she comes, tell her to get on her hands and knees. Fuck her from behind while you hold her hair in her fists and say to her, “Oh YEAH baby you love it when I FUCK you hard. You love it when I FUCK you like the naughty little slut that you are.”

Do not talk about your own pleasure in sex because it may distract her concentration from her own pleasure. You want her to concentrate on her own pleasure so that she will have a very powerful orgasm. Her orgasm is of the utmost importance, however once that happens you can talk about her pleasing you as it may serve to excite her even more.

Whilst she is on her hands and knees treat her like a piece of property and fuck her from behind while you hold her hair in your fists and say to her, “Oh yeah baby you love it when I USE YOU TO GET OFF. You’re my little cum-slut. You make me want to come so fucking hard. Fuck me hard like the bitch that you are.”

This is very exciting for a woman and sometimes serves to get her off again quickly but only do that if she’s already gotten off at least once.

Track 04 - Words About Words

DAVID SHADE :

Now a few words about words.

In the bedroom use terms like pussy and cock. Do not use proper anatomical terms like vagina and penis. That would only make her laugh. And certainly do not use funny terms like Willy the One-eyed Wonder Worm.

Similarly in the living room use proper anatomical terms like penis and vagina , do not use cock and pussy. That would be vulgar, everything in context.

As for terms you call her in the living room. Call her baby or whatever. Do not call her bitch. At all.

Pg 20

In the bedroom I the context of heightened sexual arousal, call her your bitch or slut. But never ever call her a cunt or any other term that she despises or it will break her out of state.

There are many other ideas for opportunities to use dirty talk. The remote control egg is an excellent example of that. I have a chapter about that in my book. That was a fun one.

Another example is taking her shopping for sexy underwear. Then while you two are at the nightclub and she is wearing the sexy underwear whisper a fantasy into her ear about how it makes her feel very sexy to be in that sexy underwear. And then get into a place or position where nobody can see it when you slide your hand in and start touching her while you tell her, “Everybody sees you as being a very proper woman but really I KNOW

that on the inside you are being a very naughty little girl.”

Again all of this must be done with absolute conviction. It must be totally believable and purposeful.

Now let’s talk about pillow-talk.

What you do and say right after sex is very important. You must reassure her that you see her as a beautiful innocent creature and especially that you respect her for the unique individual that she is. This is very important because you do not want her to have remorse for what has happened.

It must be remembered in good light so that it can be enjoyed again.

Say this to her, “Oh baby you make me feel so close to you. I just can’t hold you close enough.”

Then point out something about her that you really adore. Women love things that men point out in her that she likes in her, that no other man notices, especially horny men.

For example, if she has big breasts, don’t tell her how much you love her tits. Instead tell her how you adore how her waste curves in, in such a feminine way.

Then talk about deep emotional feelings that are very important to you. This lets her know that now you two have had incredible sex that you are open to being emotionally communicative. Women love that. It is the life essence of a successful relationship.

Reward her good behaviour by giving of your true self.

“If I’m with a new woman I find it hard to ask for a blowjob, because I feel she will do it if she’s comfortable and turned on. And if she’s not initiating it maybe she’s not comfortable doing it. I don’t want to put her on the sport or create awkwardness. From what you’re saying, I’m wondering if my belief about this is wrong. What is the truth about the woman who is naked in my bed but doesn’t initiate giving me a blowjob?”

DAVID SHADE :

Now I’d like to know how long has he been going out with her. If it’s the first second time in bed, don’t be in such a big hurry. Fourth or fifth time in bed, like I said it would be appropriate …

DAVID’S GIRLFRIEND :

Not to ask though, just …

Pg 21

DAVID SHADE :

But not to ask though, yeah …

You know we talk about this in the lecture. In a state of very high sexual arousal he can just say, “Suck my cock bitch”, and yeah … that’s the end of that.

However. There is the possibility you’d get an ab-reaction. That’s a hypnosis term meaning, somebody under hypnosis you tell them to do something then they freak out. It may be that she would object and then you say,

“Oh okay”, and move onto something else.

If that happens later, not in the bedroom, later when you’re in the living-room talking you say, “Oh uh, by the way when I asked you to suck me (… you know or whatever nice terms you use…) did you object to that?”, and she can probably tell you about some experience she had when she was raped or when she almost choked or whatever. And then you will be able to deal with it.

But at any rate if she doesn’t do it, it’s necessarily because she doesn’t want to do it. But you got to wonder, if a woman doesn’t do that after you’ve been in a relationship for some time.

DAVID’S GIRLFRIEND :

… You got to talk to her …

DAVID SHADE :

… It is true, they were saying, a survey was done of college students and oral sex is actually down on the list of things they would actually have protective intercourse long before they would have oral sex. So evidently now, college kids are not as concerned about warts on their genitals as they are about warts on their lip.

So there’s a lot of things going on there. But certainly if she doesn’t do it, it doesn’t mean she doesn’t want to.

She may have some reservations or she’s just waiting for you to tell her to do it.

CRAIG :

Okay he had a response where he said,

“Yes I’m talking about the first or second time in bed”

DAVID’S GIRLFRIEND :

Be patient.

DAVID SHADE :

First or second time in bed hey. Yeah. I don’t know, I mean a lot of guys get that. A lot of the field reports on the internet are not so much lay reports as BJ reports. So there’s a lot of that that goes on. I don’t know maybe you have to set the frame for that. I don’t know.

But yeah first or second time. Don’t be in such a hurry.

DAVID’S GIRLFRIEND :

A lot of women that give blowjobs on the first time, are not doing it for own pleasure or sensuality, they’re doing it to validate themselves as sexy women so you got to wonder about that Pg 22





Track 06 - Final Question & Wrap Up

CRAIG :

“I really like the discussion. I can see where I’ve used talk like this and had a great response. I also see where I need to do more of this and it ties in with discussions I’ve had with my girl roomies. And so the question is, how early on should you use strong sexual fantasy talk with, prior to getting anywhere near the bedroom?”

DAVID SHADE :

Yeah like anything else, you build it up. A little bit at a time. A little more at a time. There’s only so much you can do very early in a relationship because if you blow it all out very early then it’s just vulgar talk.

It becomes mundane.

It cheapens it and makes her feel like a slut so you cannot unload the whole thing. A little bit at a time.

Certainly early on in a relationship it’s all very romantic, touchy-feely, that kind of thing.

So you bring it on a little bit at a time. How much to bring out and when. You know calibration, man, you’re just going to watch the woman closely.

Even in a first conversation, there’s just a little bit of that going on. It slowly escalates and by the time the second date, the third date. Definitely by the third date you should have half your battalions out and certainly by the fifth date have the whole army out doing it.

And then from the fifth date, the fifth sexual encounter on, I’m just putting numbers on this you know. It’s all based on calibration. From then on, it’s all right, you introduce something new each night.

DAVID’S GIRLFRIEND :

I just wanted to say, that a lot of people have been asking questions about the first night. But really and truly for this stuff to really, really work it’s more of a long term process. It isn’t the first date or two.

DAVID SHADE :

Don’t expect that she’s going to be your very naughty horny little cum-slut fuck-bitch on the first night.

DAVID’S GIRLFRIEND :

Or second night. It takes time.

DAVID SHADE :

And remember too she’s only going to give up so much. It’s the first night. She’s only going to give of herself of what you give of yourself. If you want her to totally completely surrender to you in every way, for her to be naked to you in every way, you’re going to have to invest some of yourself.

Vol I, Issue 2 - How To Set The Foundation For A Wild Sexual Relationship Track 10 - Begin to Use Dirty Talk

The next time you two go out you can apply a little more dirty talk.

Here's an excellent example of what you can do. This example was sent by a woman, an author of a book on sexuality.

She wrote quote,

"On our third date we went to a museum and while we were walking around he started whispering things in my ear about how he’d like to tie me up and how he’d like to spank me right there in the museum and let everybody Pg 23





see me with my skirt pulled up and how much I’d probably enjoy my exposing myself because I was a naughty little slut.

I almost ran out of the museum. But I wanted to hear more, even though I was horrified. Now that I look back I realize that I was horrified because he was saying exactly what I wanted to hear.”

This is very powerful mental stuff for a sexually submissive woman. A word about dirty talk.

In our last teleseminar we talked about the art of sexy dirty talk. Dirty talk is very important in an ongoing relationship. But early in a relationship it must be done sparingly and appropriately.

The idea is to give a small taste of what is possible down the road. The idea is to perk her interest. The idea is to show that you are comfortable being dominant without being domineering. In control without being controlling.

Masculine without being macho.

It makes her feel like a woman.

But really the opportunity for a little dirty talk will probably present itself.

User comments from TP download of “David Shade – Hotphone”

I never made notes / transcript of this audio as it was too long USER Brax:

just tried heavy dirty talk with a FB last two weekends

some points:

1. she said as we fucked, she gets goosebumps all over her body as I speak with her "this way"

me: bad ?

she: no, its gooooood

2. make sure you are clear as you speak, because as I mumbled some dirty words in her ear as we fucked and she didn’t understand one word it threw her out of her ecstasy and she asked "what? what did you said?"

I don’t have even to mention what a mood killer it is, if she asks you what you've just said to her...

so if you whisper, whisper clearly

3. afterwards (later after some good sex) if I just mentioned some detailed dirty descriptive intercourse words she got instantly turned on.

USER Catch22:

oh yeah, gotta pay attention to that... if you're talking dirty to her while she's either playing with herself (over the phone) or if you're actually fucking her, SPEAK CLEARLY... cuz they WANT to hear it clearly, and if they don't hear you they will snap out of it for a bit...

mood killer, yes... learn from our mistakes and try not to let that happen to you as well, as uncomfortable as it may get talking to her dirty and raunchy and spitting all this stuff out of your pretty little mouth Pg 24

The Clitoral Orgasm

The Welcomed Method

I learned this from a sexuality research group in San Francisco called “The Welcomed Consensus.” You can find them at welcomed.com.

I viewed a video from them called “Deliberate Orgasm.” The guy in the video showed how you must directly touch the naked tip of the clitoris at its one o'clock position (as looking AT the clit) with the tip of your index finger. If you don’t understand that, you can just rub the very tip of the clit and you will pretty much get the same results.

In the video he demonstrated on a woman. He rubbed her for about 10 minutes. All the time she was orgasmic, but she never “came.” I would not recommend that. I have a variation to that below.

Have your woman lie on her back. Apply Astroglide lubricant to your hands and to her clitoris. Astroglide is a name brand lubricant. It can be found in most any drug store. You must avoid micro scratches.

You sit to her left side and place your left arm under her left leg. Put your left fingers under her ass and press your left thumb on her perineum (between her vagina and her anus.) This makes her feel secure and anchors the clitoris.

Then place the palm of your right hand on her pubic hair. Place the tip of your right index finger to the tip of her clitoris. If you prefer, you may use the tip of your middle finger. While the tip of your index finger barely touches the tip of her clit, you rub. The rubbing is to be done with the tip of the index finger pointing straight at the clit. The strokes are about one half inch and at a frequency of about 2 strokes per second.

Pg 25





Continue this stimulation. Remember, the tip of your finger should just barely touch the tip of her clit. This will feel so incredible for her.

Now here’s what you do to make it really powerful. You tell her to relax. You continue the stimulation while continually telling her to relax and just feel the pleasure.

She will be in continuous total ecstasy.

You can be sure that this is different than anything she has ever experienced before.

Even when she gets really close and wants to come, tell her not to. Lighten up on the stimulation if you have to.

Tell her to relax and tell her to continue to enjoy the pleasure that you are giving her body. She will be begging you to let her come.

Then, after an appropriate amount of time, tell her the following: You: “I love giving you pleasure. And in a moment, I am going to give you an orgasm. Do you want to have an orgasm?”

Her: “Oh God Yes!”

You: “How badly do you want to come?”

Her: “Oh God! So Bad!”

You: “When I say the words ‘Come Now’ you will instantly have an orgasm.”

Then you make the stroking firmer to give it more stimulation, and then you say to her in a commanding voice:

“Come Now!”

She will have an explosive orgasm. While she is coming, further plant the command for her to come. This associates your voice, telling her to come, with her orgasm.

Here’s the key point: To her, from her perspective, it will appear as if: Pg 26





Her explosive orgasm was caused by YOUR COMMAND!

This demonstrates to her that her sexuality is brought to life when she surrenders herself to you! It benefits her for her to follow your commands, and to do as you say.

When she surrenders to you, she becomes MORE sexual.

This also commands respect. She takes what you say much more seriously now. And as a result, she has more respect for you!

Remember, it’s not that you make her come, it’s that you have a lot to say about WHEN she comes. Do you see how this is all so very powerful? It is effective sexual techniques enhanced by effective mental techniques.

Difficult Case Studies

Question:

I gave my girlfriend her first clitoral orgasm and later after reading your "Masterful Lover Manual"

gave her vaginal orgasms. She does not orgasm every time we have sex as she "tries too hard" (her words) and now I believe we have inadvertently made the orgasm a goal.

Here's an idea for you to do on your woman.

Use the method described in "The Welcomed" method (but don't tell her what you're up to!) Tell her "Tonight there will be no goal. I am just going to spend time savouring giving you pleasure."

And then do "The Welcomed" method. But DON'T let her come!

"Baby, I don't want you to come. I want you to savour this pleasure that I am giving you." She will be in delirious pleasure. Make it slow. Make it drawn out.

She will beg to be able to come. Don't let her. After she has begged for 20 minutes, then say to her:

"Baby, do you want to come?" "YES!"

"Baby, do you want to come really hard?" "Yes!"

"Baby, if I make you come, will you show me how hard you can come for me?" "YES!"

"Baby, in a moment, I am going to make you come. And when I do, I want you to show me how fucking hard you can come for me Baby. OK?" "Yes!"

Make your strokes hard and fast.

"Ok Baby, I want you to show me now how fucking hard you can come fo r me now. Come for me NOW Baby.

Come Now!"

Use her performance anxiety to get to the goal anyway. Do this over a few nights and it will make orgasms much more fun and attainable. Over time do the same with the deep spot to awaken her responsiveness in intercourse. But always, sweep her away to a sexual state, and make it such that she surrenders to you completely. For more about that, see David Shade's Manual.

Denial

There is a place of transition, right between being really close, and actually coming, when a woman feels completely open and vulnerable. Normally it is so brief as to not be noticed, but it becomes apparent when you bring her up very... very... slowly...

On a number of occasions I have extended that place of transition for my girlfriend by bringing her up very slowly using the welcomed method with slow light stimulation. That place of transition tends to last a bit longer, like maybe a couple of seconds. But I was able to extend it indefinitely by specifically telling her that when she gets very close, she will stay there for as long as I say. I brought her up very slowly while reminding her that she cannot come. After she had been close for a very long time, I reminded her to relax and that she cannot come. She began to slip into that place of transition. As she began to feel completely open and vulnerable, I said to her "Feel completely vulnerable. Whenever I say feel completely vulnerable, you will immediately return to this place of feeling completely vulnerable." I held her there for many minutes. She was truly feeling completely open and vulnerable. She said "David, I would do anything for you." I held her there for as long as I desired, and then I said "Now, Darling, give me your orgasm." She slipped over the edge and had a massive orgasm.

Now, at any time, I can immediately return her to that place, by simply saying to her "Feel completely vulnerable."

My girlfriend was going to attend a meeting for her work in my town, so it was another opportunity for us to be together on a weeknight at my place the night before. We were enjoying conversation on the couch, when I stood up and said "Go into the bedroom, undress, and lay on the bed." She did so. After giving her sufficient time, and a little more, I went into the bedroom and enjoyed the view of her on my bed. She said "What is it?" I said "I adore looking at you. You look so beautiful to me." She smiled. I went to my wardrobe and I obtained two silk ties and I tied her wrists to the bed posts. I stood back and looked at her and said "You look helpless."

She shyly smiled and said "Yes." I said "In fact, you appear to be completely vulnerable." She looked longingly at me and softly said "Yes." I removed my belt and lightly dangled it above her body. Then I let the tip of the leather lightly touch her skin. She shivered.

I set the belt down on the bed and I sat down next to her. I looked into her eyes and said "Darling, as you remember, whenever I kiss you, your clit becomes very hard and excited, isn't that right?" She smiled and said

"Yes." I said "In fact, it is also true, that when I kiss you, your nipples become very hard and excited, just like this" and I began to suck her nipple. She immediately began to moan. I sucked her nipple until she was very close, and then I stopped. I stood up and said "That is how good your nipple feels when I kiss you." She slightly turned towards me and softly said "Yes."

I walked around to the other side of the bed and placed my face close to hers and said "Darling, whenever I kiss you, your nipples instantly become extremely hard and excited, just like this" and I sucked her other nipple. I nibbled and tugged and sucked her nipple until she became very close, and then I stopped. She breathlessly said

"Oh God."

I walked to the foot of the bed and said "I am now going to remind you how hard and excited your clit gets when I kiss you. Spread your legs." She did so, and then I crawled onto the bed and began to very slowly and lightly lick her clit. I brought her up very slowly until she was very close, and then I stopped. She was gasping for air, and for the orgasm I was not letting her have. But sure enough, she was feeling completely open and vulnerable.

Pg 28

I obtained the Astroglide and then sat next to her. I lubed up my fingers and began doing the Welcomed method on her very slowly and very softly. She soon became very close again, but I slowed and lightened up even more to hold her orgasm away. Then I stopped and said "This is how good your clit feels every time I kiss you." She just gritted her teeth. I waited a few moments and then began touching her again, and again making it even slower and softer as she got closer. I said "This is how excited your clit gets every time I kiss you." With feather light touches I kept her right on the edge. I said "Every time I kiss you your clit feels this fucking good." Then I stopped.

I stood up and wiped my hands off on a small towel. She said "David, I cannot put my legs together. My clit is so hard that I can't put my legs together." I simply said "I know. Turn to the side." She put her legs together and she turned as much of her body to the side as she could, as her arms were still held wide apart.

I picked up the belt and said "Right now, you are feeling very naughty. In fact, you are being a very bad girl.

You need to be disciplined." She began to breathe quickly. I held the buckle of my belt with one hand, the middle of the belt with the other, and then I slapped the free end of the belt against her ass. She flinched. I slapped her again and it made a loud snap. She gasped. I repeatedly slapped her ass, one side and then the other, being careful not to hurt her or make any marks, while saying "You have been a very bad girl, and Daddy is disciplining you." She was going nuts. Just as she got very close, I stopped. She quivered and said "Oh God David."

I stood back and looked upon her for a while as she caught her breath. When she then looked up at me, I said

"Roll back onto your back and open your legs." She did, and I sat next to her and said "I am now going to remind you how good your pussy feels when I kiss you" and I slowly slid my finger into her vagina. She closed her eyes and rolled her head back. I softly pressed against her deep spot, but I had to be careful not to make her come, as she was already so close. I said "This is how good your pussy is going to feel whenever I kiss you."

She tightly closed her eyes and brought her head forward, trying hard for her orgasm, which I was not going to let her have. I held my finger still, and she gave up trying, knowing that I was not going to let her have it, and she took the opportunity to gather some air. I had to very carefully remove my finger as that stimulation alone could have been enough to make her come. She was that close.

I let my finger slide down to her anus and I said "In fact, whenever I kiss you, you will find that your ass becomes very excited." I gently slid my finger in while saying "Every time I kiss you, your ass will become extremely excited." Once in, I slowly slid my finger in and out, slower, and then just keeping it still. She wanted to come so badly that she began to ride my finger. I said "This is how excited your ass will become every time I kiss you, isn't that right?" She said "YES!" I said "In fact, your ass will become so excited that it will want to ride my cock, isn't that right?" She said "Oh God Yes." Just as she got very close, I slowly withdrew. She curled up and shivered and said "Oh God David."

I then undressed as I said to her "You do recall how very excited your lips feel when you feel my pleasure against your lips, don't you?" She said "Yes." I said "I am now going to remind you how excited your lips become every time you kiss me." I positioned myself above her face and said "Every time I kiss you, your lips are going to feel as excited as when you SUCK MY COCK!" She started sucking as if she wanted to come so badly. I said "Yes, this is how fucking good your lips feel every time I kiss you." Just as she got really close, I withdrew.

I stood up next to the bed and looked down at her. I wanted to take some time before the grand finale so she could slip a bit farther away from her elusive orgasm. I said to her "Every time you kiss me, you will crave me."

She longingly said "Oh Yes." I said "You feel completely vulnerable to me right now, don't you?" "Yes." "You love it when you surrender yourself completely to me, don't you?" "Yes." "You do understand that I could make you come instantly by simply saying five words to you, don't you?" "Yes." "You do understand that I am in Pg 29

complete control of your entire body." "Yes." "You do understand that I am in complete control of every pleasure that you feel, isn't that right?" "Yes."

The suggestions were more than sufficiently planted, and it was time to reward her good behavior. I got on the bed and placed my knees between hers and my hands on either side of her chest and said "In fact, whenever you kiss me, you will crave to feel my cock in your pussy. I know how much your pussy aches to feel me enter you." She gasped "Oh David." I let just the tip of my cock slide in, and I held still. I said "This is how badly your pussy aches for my cock." I slowly slid the tip in and out, just titillating her pussy. She was losing her mind. I said "Now Baby, I want you to show me how excited you get when you kiss me. Show me how excited that makes you." "Yes David." "Right now you feel completely vulnerable to me, don't you?" "Yes David."

"Right now you would do anything for me, wouldn't you?" "Oh God Yes David." As I continued to titillate her pussy with the tip of my cock, I said "What I want you to do is, I want you to show me how good you can come for me Baby." She was trying very hard with the limited stimulation I was giving her. I said "Give me your orgasm Baby." She became very stiff and she went over the edge and began her orgasm. When she was coming, I began pumping her hard and deep and fast. She started coming so hard that she started an ear piercing scream.

Fearing that the neighbors would file another noise complaint against me with the apartment complex management, I firmly placed my hand over her open mouth while being careful to leave her nostrils clear. I continued pumping her hard and saying "Come like a good girl. Hard! Show me how fucking hard you come for me. Come Hard Baby. Hard!" while she screamed silently into my palm. This lasted for almost a minute.

When she was done, I untied her hands, and she wrapped her arms tightly around me. We held each other for a while. It was time for me to give her the reward that she cherishes the most. I said to her "Darling, you please me greatly. I want to show you how much pleasure you give me" and I started making love to her with long slow strokes as I said to her what I knew would make her crazy "Baby, you make me feel so good. Baby, make my cum come out of me." I normally don't bring my own pleasure to a woman's attention, as it tends to distract her from her orgasm, but in this particular instance, she was so aroused and so ready to come again, that doing so would actually increase her pleasure. She was keeping up with me. She can also feel my energy when I get really close, especially when we are face to face, and it is enough to make her come. I said "Baby, take my cum.

Baby, take my orgasm, take my orgasm and make it yours." As she felt my energy, we shared an orgasm together. Fortunately she was much quieter this time.

As we were falling asleep, she said "David, I am so wildly crazy about you. I am so madly in love with you."

In the morning I woke up to see her putting on her blue pinstripe skirted suit for work. She said "Good morning Honey. I have to go to work now, this is a very important meeting." I followed her to the door where she threw her overnight bag over her shoulder. She turned to me and said "Last night was so exciting Baby" and then she kissed me. Instantly she melted and fell against me. I caught her and stood her back up straight. She said "Oh my God! I just instantly got SO horny! Damn, I wish I didn't have to go." The suggestions appeared to have worked.

That night she called me and said "I thought about you all day long. You evoke such powerful emotions in me.

You touch parts of me that nobody has been able to touch. You touch me in ways I have always wanted to be touched. The way you touched me was so powerful, so beautiful. It's what life is all about. I feel so alive."

This is so powerful.

On later occasions, I would again bring her up very slowly, but when I got to the licking of the clit part, I would make my licking even lighter and slower, bringing her right to the very edge. Then with the very slightest touch with the tip of my tongue on the tip of her clit, I would continue to hold her right on the very edge, for a very...

very... long time. She would be fucking loosing it. Eventually, with just the very slightest of touch, she would Pg 30





finally go over the edge. While I maintained the very slightest of touch, she would have a spectacular orgasm.

Awesome.

Soon after that, I received a thirty day notice of eviction due to all the noise complaints. So I signed a lease with a new complex down the street. I was furious at the time, but it's funny now when I look back on it. Sort of like a badge of honor.

Anticipation and Vulnerability

I was to leave for a business trip on a Sunday, so on Saturday night, after my girlfriend and I returned to my place after going out for dinner, we decided to make it an evening at home to spend quality time together enjoying loving, tender intimacy, which we both savor. But I had planned to give her something to really think about in my absence...

I asked her to go into the bedroom and change into the sexy black bra, panties, and high heels that I like to see her in. As she did that, I went to my suitcase by the front door and took out two silk ties, and placed a knot in the middle of each. When she returned, I told her how beautiful she looked to me, and I led her to the doorway of my bathroom. She asked me what I was doing, but I did not answer. I tied a silk tie to each of her wrists and then raised her hands far above her head and threw the ties over the top of the bathroom door, and then closed the door behind her, with the knots caught behind the top of the door, thus leaving her restrained in front of the bathroom. I could easily free her by simply opening the door, but there was nothing she could do. I stepped backwards into my living room and admired the view of her. Then I went back to her and bent down and slid her panties down to her ankles, and I then went to my desk and turned on my laptop and began working on some material I had to prepare for my trip.

I worked on a presentation I was going to give on my trip. About 15 minutes into that, my girlfriend said "Did you forget about me?" I continued working on my presentation. I also had some files I wanted to download from my desktop to my laptop. I fiddled with some networking, and then started downloading the files. Then my girlfriend said "I'm getting bored." I went to my suitcase and obtained another silk tie and walked up to her and looked her straight in the eyes and said "I have a lot of work to do. I want you to be quiet" and I placed the tie over her mouth and tied it behind her head. I then returned to my work.

After about a half hour, I finished the presentation, and went to my desktop computer and began reading emails.

I did that for another half hour. I then went into the bedroom and brought another suitcase into the living room.

I gathered some more things from around my house that I needed for my trip and packed them into the suitcase.

When I was done packing, I went to her and put my finger under her chin to raise her head back up, and I said

"You do understand that you are my little cum slut. I use you to get off. I haven't decided yet if I'm going to fuck you in the ass or if I'm going to fuck your face." I went into my bedroom and obtained some Astroglide and a butt plug that I had purchased the day before, unknown to her, and returned. I held her arms and turned her around such that she was facing the door. I said "You are my slutty little bitch" as I lubed up her ass. I leaned against her, pressing her firmly into the door, and said "You're entire purpose is for me to get off"

as I slowly slid the plug up her ass and she started moaning.

I stood back and removed my belt and said "Just look at you. You get off on having a plug up your ass. You are such a naughty little bitch." I slapped her with my belt. She moaned more. I continued slapping her, being sure to hit the butt plug. She was going crazy. I said "Don't come! Whatever you do, don't come!" I placed my mouth closely to her ear and softly said "You are very close right now, you are so fucking close. That's how fucking naughty you are. You are nothing but my little slutty bitch. You are so naughty." I stood back and slapped her some more, and she was losing her mind.

Pg 31





I then untied the tie over her mouth and I held her with one arm as I carefully opened the door with the other. I held her as she slowly went down to her hands and knees. I unzipped my pants and demanded "Suck my cock bitch!" She went at it like an obedient slave, but not with the enthusiasm that I required. I grabbed her hair and slightly forced her motions while saying "Suck my cock right bitch. Suck my cock good!" Just as she was getting very close again, I pulled her head back. I said "Get up, and go get on the bed on your hands and knees."

She had to untangle her panties from her shoes, so she just pulled her shoes off to free herself. I helped her up and she walked into the bedroom as I followed. After she assumed the position on the bed, I disrobed and got on the bed behind. I started fucking her pussy while pressing her butt plug in and out and saying "You're my little cum slut fuck bitch, and I use you to get off!" She went ballistic and started screaming when she started coming.

(I had already arranged for the movers, so I was no longer concerned about the neighbors complaining.) I forced harder and ordered her to come harder, and she continued coming and screaming for what must have been two minutes. (No doubt that made the neighbors jealous.)

When she was done, I pulled the plug from her ass, and she gasped and shivered. Usually, just after she has come, her ass is much too sensitive for any kind of further stimulation. But this time I was merciless. I said

"You are my little cum slut. You are here for my pleasure, and I am going to take it now!" and I did the dirty deed. She was back at it. I said "Now I remember why you're my little fuck bitch, 'cause your butt makes my dick come so fucking good. Yeah, you're gonna make my cock get off hard." It led to another equally enthusiastic orgasm.

By this time, I was pretty much ready for my grand finale. I ordered her onto her back and I sat above her stomach and I began working on producing my sperm sample while saying "You love it when I blow my wad all over your face." She was a very good girl and took it with an open mouth and open eyes. Some if it, however, got up her nose, and she was puffing hard to get it out. When we both realized how funny it was, we started rolling in hysterical laughter.

Answers to Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some questions I have received. These men gave me permission to repeat their questions here.

"David, could you give an example of what it means to be an Alpha-male in the bedroom?"

I don't really relate with the term 'Alpha-male' as it has many connotations, but if I understand what you are getting at, I will share one of my experiences. It was a late Sunday night...

My girlfriend and I were very tired after a long weekend of late nights at the night clubs and then tender love making way into the night. So on Sunday night she went to bed early. Unfortunately I had to stay up to do my taxes. I finally finished the Federal taxes at 2:00 AM. (Damn Schedule D for capital gains!) I was still wide awake from all the coffee. I contemplated doing my state taxes or doing my girlfriend. After about a half second of deliberation, I went into the bedroom and undressed and then I pulled the covers down and woke her up by saying "You need my cock" while I pulled her panties off. She was blinking and looking for the clock to see what time it was. I immediately separated her legs and started licking her clit. She stopped wondering about the time and started holding her breath. In about a minute she came. While she was still catching her breath, I got on top of her and started doing the nasty while telling her "You love it when I fuck you hard like the horny little bitch that you are." She probably woke the neighbors when she came again. Then I got up and said to her

"Assume the position and take it up the ass like the horny little slut that you are" as I went to my dresser for the Astroglide. She slowly turned over onto her hands and knees just as I returned to lube her up. Then I did the dirty deed while holding a fist full of her hair and telling her "You love it when I fuck you hard up the ass like the horny little bitch that you are. You are a very naughty little girl." She came again. Then I laid on my back and told her to get on top of me with her back to me and to watch herself in the mirror as she impaled her ass upon me. As she did that I said "You love watching your ass ride up and down on my cock. That makes you so Pg 32

fucking hot. Show me how good you can fuck your strong man with your ass!" She was going fucking nuts and came again. Then I said "Now lube me up and jack me off and take my cum all over your face. You love it when I blow my wad all over your face." She was more than happy to oblige.

CE wrote:

"It takes my girlfriend forever to come, if she does at all. I read at tantra.com that 'men do not give women orgasms, women allow themselves to have orgasms. Unless your partner can give herself up to the pleasures of her body, she won't have orgasms. "

Hogwash. That is total Mars/Venus passive bullshit. Besides, where's the fun in it if you're not Making each other have orgasms?

Don't make your woman surrender to the pleasures in her body, make her surrender to YOU.

Above all else, your woman must be responsive to you. Are you working on that? Are you rewarding good behavior and withdrawing upon bad behavior? Are you training her on new ways to have an orgasm? Are you continually expanding her envelop of sexuality? She must understand that her true fulfillment lies in her being completely responsive to you. A woman is most excited and most fulfilled when she is completely surrendered to her strong man.

But for a woman to feel completely surrendered to her man to the point of completely giving over and responding to every command, she must have that special kind of respect for him that only becomes true when she sees in him a sense of personal power to the point that it creates in her a slight tingle of fear, but at the same time, she knows that she has earned the unique status of being benefited by it instead of being threatened by it.

Do you understand?

Crank up that sense of personal power and sensuality to the point where your woman understands in you a part that is almost scary, but for her, it is there for her enhanced pleasure. That's where true respect comes in, and where responsiveness begins. Understand? Don't be the man that all women like but few respond to. Be the personally and sensually powerful man that the really sexual ones are drawn to and are super responsive to.

I know you like using the deep spot technique, but that is just a touching technique. You should be able to simply count to ten and your woman will have an orgasm. You should be able to say just two words to her and she will Come Now.

You read that chapter about that highly sexual woman I met in the coffee shop. It got off to a slow start the first night when I used the deep spot and the welcomed method. It was not until the next night, when I engaged her imagination and demonstrated to her the power I could affect over her, that things took off. It was when she understood that I could make her feel anything, and she could not help it, that she became responsive to me.

Subsequent times together were marked by a continual stream of wild screaming orgasms. She then would instantly come on command and for as long as I insisted on it. And all without "hypnotizing" her.

CE continued: "I am still working on the 'come on command' technique. My current girlfriend really likes the idea, she loves being hypnotized, but this method has yet to work."

She is not following your commands, and you are not engaging her imagination. Instead, bring her imagination to life. Make it real. And at all times, she must follow your commands, or everything stops until she can agree to the terms.

You must be prepared to withdraw when she does not follow your commands. That instills a fear of loss in her.

Another point towards that required level of respect. It may also instill a fear of loss in you, in that it may cause Pg 33

you to lose her. That's where the personally powerful part steps in. Have the respect enough for yourself to demand only the best for you. She can take it or leave it. If she leaves, probably a good thing. If she agrees to it, that is one more demonstration to her of the respect she has for you. Another demonstration to her of the power you have.

I think the reason why I responded so strongly to learning hypnosis was the fact that I was as much afraid of it as I was fascinated by it. Once I experienced it and learned how to do it and found how easy and fun it was, it had a very powerful affect on me, and from that was born the realization of my own personal power.

That becomes true for a woman as well. When she sees for herself how powerfully she responds to her own imagination, which is driven by you, she begins to find in herself her own sense of personal power. That's when the flood gates open and anything becomes possible.

Alright, that is the high level stuff, the what you must BE. Now let's talk about the details of what you could say and do.

Remember, the idea is not so much that you make your woman come, but that you have a lot to say about when and how long your woman comes.

There are any number of different possibilities, but I will illustrate two here.

Train her to come ONLY when you say to. Bring Astro Glide and do the welcomed method of stimulating her clitoris. Tell her that you know a way to touch a woman that will make her feel incredible. But don't drive hard for the orgasm; instead tell her to relax and breath normally so that she will enjoy it more. She will comply with your commands, because it will feel so good that she won't want to come. If she does get too close, let off a little and insist that she relax. Now is the time that she is to surrender to you. Tell her "Now Baby, show me how good you can feel. But you cannot come. Show me how fucking good you can feel!" Make sure she is showing you how good she can feel. Coach her on more. Insist that she shows you in a very vocal and enthusiastic manner how good she can feel. As she does so, she begins to realize that she is surrendering to YOU, not her own feelings. She will be concentrated on surrendering to you and forget her self-distractions. But don't let her come. Say "Don't come Baby, I want you to show me how good you can feel, but you cannot come until I say you can come." After you do that for a while, she will be begging you to let her come. Tease her for a while longer and then it is time for you to make her come. Drive hard and say "Now Baby, I want you to show me how good you can come. Show me how fucking hard you can come. Come Now! Show me how fucking hard you can come! Come Now!" Continue saying it as she comes. This will set a powerful anchor to your voice command. Insist that she keeps coming harder and harder. If she doesn't come, then step back and say

"Listen, maybe we can do this another time when you are ready to show me how good you can feel in response to my touch. I have to go reply to some emails." And leave the room. If she's not going to be responsive to you, there's no point.

Another thing you can do is make her masturbate in front of you. Have her masturbate while you narrate a fantasy into her ear. Pick a fantasy you know she will respond to. Make the fantasy real. Bring it to life. Make sure her imagination is bringing the fantasy to life. If she comes, she is further convinced that she is responsive to you. If she does not, leave as described above.

If she does not have a sense of imagination, she ain't gonna be any fun. Sex will continually be a frustrating experience. And for her, she will grow bored of it, and she will leave to find another man "who can give her that big O" which she will not find, because she seeks power from outside of herself.

Which brings us back around to what tantra.com wrote. It is true that a woman must take some responsibility, but it is not to her own pleasure, it is to be responsive to her lover. The danger in the statement is that it releases Pg 34





you from responsibility. You are the one who engages her imagination and shows her the personal power within herself. That is, if there is any in there. If there is not, let her go. If there is, she will become aware of her own personal power and she will be forever grateful to you. It is then that the flood gates open to a whole new world of responsiveness where anything is possible.

Legendary Lover Vol. 3 - Hot Sex Techniques

Dirty Talk

Think you like dirty talk? You may be as surprised to learn that 99% of the women out there love it too. In fact, women are even more sexually excited by the power of words than men. Even if she’s too shy to confess up to it, sexy talk, dirty talk, or any kind of talk allows them to be the “bad girl” they desperately want to be in the bedroom. Dirty talk gives sex a sexual tension and a “naughty” edge that creates hot excitement. Dirty talk doesn’t have to be limited to the bedroom either. If she calls you on the phone and asks what you’ve been doing you can tell her, “Well, I just took a hot shower and jerked off while thinking about fucking you.” You can learn to talk dirty to her during anytime of the day and in any situation.

How dirty is too dirty?

However, a particular woman’s idea of “dirty” is often different from a man’s. If she says, “Talk dirty to me,”

and you say, “Suck my cock, you filthy little whore,” she may freak out because what she wanted to hear was,

“I love your delicious pussy juices, honey.” If she says “Tell me about your wildest fantasy,” and you say, “Piss all over me,” she may freak out because what she wanted to hear was, “I want to lick whipped cream off your nipples.” So start your dirty talk out as PG-13 and gage your woman’s reaction before getting into the really nasty talk.

Also, don’t confuse dirty talk and her fantasies with what she’ll actually go through in real life. Even if you describe a fantasy to her of getting gangbanged by bunch of construction workers and she says, “I want it…!”

while enjoying sexual intercourse with you, doesn’t mean she’ll go through with a gangbang in real life. In your s she knows she’s safe and secure in being open to the thrill of the idea of being served by several men while avoiding the complications that would result if it really happened.

Dirty Word Strip Down

Your woman might be a little gun shy about using words like “cock”, “pussy”, or “slut”. If so, you should play with this game with her. First, explain to her that you want to have a little fun using dirty words that you wouldn’t normally use. If she’s resistant, tell her that you think she’s the kind of woman who is open minded and that you really love that about her.

In this game, start with a keyword like “penis” and take turns thinking of synonyms (other words that have the same meaning for it) like “cock”, “pecker”, and “dick”. First you think of a synonym and then she has to think of a synonym. Then your turn again. Keep a clicking timer so that she only has 30 seconds to think of one – or she loses!

Whoever can’t think of another synonym within the 30 seconds time limit gets playfully spanked and has to take off an item of clothing. Just remember to be playful and fun and take any plausible sounding synonym as a good answer, even if it doesn’t technically exist.

Here are some keywords you can use to spin synonyms off from:

Penis

Vagina

Masturbate

Clitoris

Slut

Stud

Dirty

Sperm

Orgasm

Vaginal Juices

Butt

Lick

Breasts

Nipple

Testes (balls)

Oh yes!

Penetrate

Aroused

Pg 37

Technique #1: Pace the sex action

Pacing the sex action means describing the sex that’s happening in the moment. Here are some examples.

 As you press your penis into her vagina say, “Putting my cock into your tight pussy feels sooo good.”

 As you penetrate her from behind doggie-style say, “Your ass looks so good up in the air like that as I pound your pussy with my dick.”

 As she gives you a blowjob say, “You’re just like a total slut when you suck my cock nasty like that.”

Technique #2: Pace her inner desires

Pacing her inner desires means telling her how much she really wants sex and how much she really wants to be dirty. For example;

 “You know you want to suck your strong man’s cock.”

 “It feels good, doesn’t it, you like that don’t you.”

 “The more you feel, the better it is and the more you want it.”

 “You like it when I touch you this way. You’re just a little slut deep down inside, aren’t you?”

 “You’re a very naughty little girl aren’t you?”

 “You enjoy to be told what to do by a man.”

 “You love watching your dirty ass ride up and down on my hard dick. That makes you so fucking hot.”

Even though many of these are phrased as questions, you should say them to her as commands.

Technique #3: Double Affirmations

If you tell her, “You’re a little slut aren’t you?” make sure that you get some form of agreement from her like a nod of the head or a yes. This is an affirmation and makes it more real to her when she responds herself.

For an even more powerful effect, especially when she doesn’t say “yes” like she means it, have her give you a double affirmation or even a triple affirmation. Each time she should agree with you with even more conviction that she’s a slut/nasty/horny girl or whatever. Here’s an example of a triple affirmation.

You:

You’re a very horny little girl aren’t you?

Her:

…yes…

You:

You didn’t say that with very much conviction. I want you to tell me that you’re a very horny little girl like you mean it.

Her:

…I’m a very horny little girl...

You:

Tell me like you mean it. Tell me how horny you are. Tell me how much you want my cock inside you’re so horny. I want to hear it.

Her:

I’m so horny I want your cock inside of me!… please…

Also, in the second or third affirmations avoid asking open-ended questions like, “You didn’t say that like you meant it! In what way are you horny?” She will have to think too much and it will break her highly aroused state.

Technique #4: Madonna-Whore Duality

Women get turned on when you directly contrast her outer Madonna that the world normally sees to her inner slut.

For example you might say to her, “To everyone else you act like such a nice, innocent girl… but I know that deep inside you’re just a horny cocksucking slut who likes to be talked dirty to. If only they all knew what a little slut you really were inside.”

Technique #5: Get her dirty-talk trance words

The words that she repeats frequently are her dirty-talk trance words. For instance, when you talk dirty to her she might often use the words “cunt” and “dick” rather than “pussy” and “cock”. By using those very same words she tends to use, you will tap directly into her subconscious desires and fantasies. After all, those are the Pg 38





words she will be thinking with and most familiar with. When she hears you use her very same dirty-talk trance words, she’ll feel you understand her completely and whatever you say much more likely to be liked.

Technique #6: Commands

Even high-powered career women enjoy giving up control and being submissive in the bedroom. The simple act of commanding a woman to perform such-and-such nasty act on you is its own form of dirty talk. For example,

 “I said get on your knees… now spread those legs wide.”

 “Put your head down here… now lick those balls as wet and dirty as you can… that’s it.”

 “Finger yourself as you suck me off.”

 “Assume the position and take it up the ass like the horny little girl you are.”

 “Watch yourself in the mirror as you impale your cunt on my dick.”

Technique #7: Describe a forbidden fantasy

You can also tell your woman a forbidden fantasy while you make love to her. Remember, what makes dirty talk exciting is that it’s “forbidden”, so explore her boundaries a little. In any case, be as vivid and detailed as possible to make it real in her mind. For example, “Take my hard cock and let it slowly slide in and out of your hot wet mouth until some of that excess saliva which hangs between your tongue and the tip of my cock finally snaps and lands on your face,” is vivid and, “Suck my cock baby!” is not.

Legendary Lover Vol. 4 - The Art of Sexy Talk





Chapter 1: Sexy Talk


Message to the reader


In this book you’ll learn all about the art of seductive sexy and dirty talk. Now the real question is… why bother?

Because seduction doesn’t end the moment you get a woman into bed. At least not a Perfect 10. You see, a Perfect 10 has endless choice in men. Perfect 10s often keep a few boyfriends that they sleep with at one time, along with a couple of dozen guy friends who all want to get into her pants.So, assuming you get a Perfect 10, what makes you think you can keep her?

Because inevitably, there will be a guy who comes along who is better than YOU. Better looking than you, richer than you, or just simply conveys more playful-alphaness than you. But there’s ONE way to keep a Perfect 10 (or any really got girl for that matter) with unlimited choice coming back to you again and again, always wanting more. There’s ONE way to keep a Perfect 10 from straying.

And that’s to be a Legendary Lover in bed – a lover who touches her, kisses her, licks her, and penetrates her like no other man she’s ever experienced before or ever will again.

Think about it. In the long run, would you rather have a girl who is slightly prettier, but just lays there and complains and acts like a dead fish in bed, or a slightly more average girl who deep throats you, gives you long blow jobs, craves riding you, wants to take it up anyway you like it, is bubbly and vivacious, and is a general thrill to be with?

And part of that skill in pleasuring a woman is not just how you touch, kiss, lick, and penetrate her – but how you TALK to her. Thus, the seduction continues long after the first time with a woman. The seduction continues every day. And if you stop, you can lose her. This book is all about how to continue that seduction – through sexy and dirty talk and taking verbal CONTROL of your sex life – and being the best lover your woman could ever hope for.

Pg 39

What is sexy and dirty talk?

People misunderstand what talking sexy and dirty really means. Talking sexy and dirty does not mean being degrading, disgusting, or demeaning to a woman.

Rather, talking sexy and dirty is a way to convey MOOD. It’s a way to enhance sex to be more provocative, enticing, electrifying, and seductive.

The very act of talking sexy and dirty changes the way a woman experiences sex in her head. Talking sexy and dirty turbo-charges her lovemaking, connects her to her deepest desires, connects her to her most profound passions, and gives her sexual freedom.

Think about this. What if you were with a woman and you couldn’t vocalize ANY sounds at all. You couldn’t the woman any verbal feedback, not even a slight moan. Imagine if you had to be perfectly quiet during sex.

Not only would it be dull, but the women could get confused, have a misunderstanding, or become frustrated without any kind of verbal feedback from you.

After all, sex is as much mental as it is physical and if you couldn’t even make a sound, sex is not going to be as hot, as passionate, or as steamy. Sound itself is a powerful erotic tool that can heighten pleasure, magnify feelings, and intensify orgasm.

That’s why your voice is so important to the quality of the woman’s experience.

And once you can tap into the power of your voice, you’ll discover all kinds of powerful erotic feelings inside of YOU as well that you never knew were there.

Madonna in public, whore in private

You might think that women who act like proper “ladies” in public would be turned off by dirty and sexy talk.

Just keep in mind that every woman has two sides to them. In public, they don’t want to look like a “slut” due to the social pressure and programming placed on them by society.

However, in the bedroom women want a man who will let them get in touch with their sexual selves without being judging. They want a man who will encourage them to experiment with all of their sexual fantasies.

You'd be surprised how many women confess to liking sexy talk, dirty talk, or any type of verbal exchange that allows them to play with the energy of being less of a good girl. Being a “bad girl” women to find their sexual selves.

In fact, women are even more sexually excited by the power of words than men. Even if she’s too shy to confess up to it, sexy talk, dirty talk, or any kind of talk that allows her to be the “bad girl” will turn her on.

Dirty talk gives sex a sexual tension and an edge that creates hot excitement.

The reality is that most women can only climax really hard when there’s some sort of verbal play involve.

A few notes

A few girls aren’t afraid to initiate new sexual adventures and aren’t afraid to reveal their true desires.

But most girls find themselves afraid to initiate sexy talk, are afraid to rock the boat, and are afraid to be too sexual. That means good girls do a lot of waiting. A lot of waiting for YOU… waiting for you to want her…

waiting for you to turn her on… waiting for you to take the lead… waiting for you to touch her… waiting for you to excite her… and waiting for you to talk hot to her.

Pg 40





When first initiating something new, tell her that you think she’s the kind of woman who is open minded and that you really love that about her. Tell her how much you love her and how important it is for you to be able to express your love more fully.

Talk with her about what turns her on. That way you'll really know what it takes for each of you to be excited about sex. For example, ask her:

- “What sexy words do you like to hear?”

- “How would you talk sexy? Would you be forceful, playful, gentle, pleading, demanding, screaming ?”

- “What sexual fantasies do you have?”

- “How do you need to be touched?”

BUT DON’T ASK TOO MUCH! Strike a balance between finding out what she likes and just taking charge.

But even when you initiate, keep in mind the suddenly talking sexy and dirty for the first time to your girl for the first time can feel scary, threatening, or confusing to some girls, particularly if they’ve been in a long-term relationship with you. It can make her feel insecure or left out or even suspicious and angry.

So always be sensitive to the responses of your woman.

The goal of this book

Now before we get started, if there’s one thing that stops some men from talking sexy and dirty, it’s their fear of change.

In this book I’ll be showing a number of exercises for you to explore, language, your voice, and the expression of fantasies. This will require you to be open-minded, exploratory, and non-judgmental. You’ll be stepping out of the normal face that you put on for your co-workers, for your family, for your friends, and be stepping IN to a new sexier self, a sexy role.

Remember, everything that you practice is play. After all, the very nature of any kind of sexy or dirty talk to a woman is playful. Have fun. Let loose a little. Extend your normal boundaries of what’s possible, all in a playful manner. In other words, let’s not take any of this too seriously. It’s a role than you can step into and you can just easily step out of and leave it behind. And like all play, you’re not graded. This is not school. There’s no right or wrong.

You’ll even learn how that through sexy and dirty talk, you’ll bring yourself closer to women, become more communicative, open, and intimate with women, and maybe even learn something new about your woman that you didn’t know before.

Synonym game

If you’re with a girl and want to get HER talking dirty, there’s a fun game you can play with synonyms that will quickly turn her speaking more filthy words than a drunken sailor.

Introduce the Sexy Word Game by telling your girl that you want to have a little fun using sexy and dirty words that you normally wouldn’t use. Tell her that together you’re going to think up alternatives to the word “sexy”,

“penis”, “fuck” or any other racy word. Once you pick a word, let’s say “fuck”, you’ll take turns thinking of synonyms. First she thinks of a synonym, then you, then her again.

Whoever is the first to be stumped for a fresh synonym loses the round – and has to take a playful spanking, give the other one a kiss, or take off an item of clothing. This is even a great game to play with girls who you haven’t slept with yet – a sexy game to seduce her.

Just remember to be playful and fun and take any plausible sounding synonym as a good answer, even if it doesn’t technically exist.

Chapter 3: Structure

There are a number of specific sexy/dirty talk language structures that you can use.

By knowing the language structures of sexy/dirty talk, you’ll be able to jump right in and be a pro at making women crazy hot right away with virtually little or no practice. Just as a doctor uses established medical practices, customs, and guidelines to diagnose and heal a patient, so can you use established structures of sexy/dirty talk to quickly and effectively take girls from cold to wet and begging for satisfaction.

You’ll want to know at least one or two, but they work best when you mix and match them for variety and all sorts of interesting combinations.

1. Pacing the Action

The first language structure of sexy/dirty talk is “Pacing the Action”. In other words, this means telling her,

“What I am doing to you and what you are doing to me” as the sex action happens. Pacing the action means describing the sex that’s happening in the moment.

For example…

…as you press your penis into her vagina say, “I’m putting my cock into your pussy… it feels so good being in that hot pussy.”

…as you penetrate her from behind doggie-style say, “Your ass looks so good up in the air like that as I pound your pussy with my dick.”

Pg 42

…as she gives you a blowjob say, “Yeah, put that pretty little mouth on my dick… swallow that cock down your throat.”

You can also use sexy language that’s a little more tame. You'd be surprised how much more erotic licking your partner is when you're saying what you're doing at the same time.

…as you give her oral sex say, “I love licking you all over.”

…as you’re removing her clothes say, “I’m undressing you now. You look so sexy half dressed.”

…as you push her down say, “I’m bending you over and sticking my dick in your pussy.”

2. Future Pacing The Action

You can also “Future Pace the Action”. This is just like pacing, except you’re describing the action that you WILL be doing to her before you do it.

When you say, "Now I'm going to gently suck on your tits," it allows for a woman to anticipate what's coming next. This technique works especially well when the lights are out and it’s pitch black.

Also, future pacing the action is sexy in a different way than presently pacing the action because it implies you’ll be leading and controlling the girl’s actions – and women find it sexy when there man takes control in the bedroom.

If we take the examples from pacing, you can easily translate them into future pacing by putting them in the future tense.

 “I’m GOING TO put my cock into your pussy… it WILL feel so good being in that hot pussy.”

 “Your ass WILL look so good up in the air like that as I pound your pussy with my dick.”

 “Yeah, you WILL put that pretty little mouth on my dick… and swallow that cock down your throat.”

 “I’m going to spread your legs wide open and lick all of your pussy juices baby.”

3. Lead and Command

A variation of Future Pacing the Action is “Lead and Command”. In Future Pacing the Action, you’re telling a woman what she will be doing in the near future. When Leading and Commanding, you’re telling a woman what she will do right NOW.

Leading and Commanding is inherently dominant and aggressive – the very qualities that women want in a man in the bedroom. Even high-powered career women enjoy giving up control and being submissive in the bedroom. It brings in the whole role of dominance and submission and on a certain level the rape fantasy – that she’s so desirable that you will take her right there right now and the choice is taken off of her shoulders. She’s free to be a “slut” because she did not actively pursue the sex – she had sex despite herself which makes sex

“okay”.

Now there are two kinds of actions you can command. Things she should do for you to perform on her, and what she should do to perform on you.

Here are examples of commanding her so that you can perform on her.

 “I said get on your knees… now spread those legs wide.”

 “Assume the position and take it up the ass like the horny little girl you are.”

Here are examples of commanding her to perform on you.

Pg 43

 “Put your head down here… now lick those balls as wet and dirty as you can… that’s it.”

 “Watch yourself in the mirror as you impale your cunt on my dick.”

You can also command her to perform on herself.

 “Finger yourself as you suck me off.”

 “Take your tit in your hand and kiss it baby.”

Notice that Leading and Commanding is very VERB oriented. “Kiss”, “lick”, “suck”, “undress”, “masturbate”,

“spread” and so on are all powerful action verbs and will get a girl hot and turned on when she hears them.

Remember that women, on a certain level, like to be led in the bedroom. So don’t add to many “softeners” to your leading and commanding. A softener is a phrase you put at the beginning of a sentence to soften the sentence like “Would you,” “I think,” or “I would like”.

Imagine you’re presenting ideas to your boss and he’s a real hard ass. Instead of saying in a commanding way,

“This is a good idea,” you might throw a softener in. “I think this is a good idea.” Notice, this is submissive.

When commanding and leading, you want to be DOMINANT.

Actually, it doesn’t matter if you throw in a softener as long as you say it in a commanding way. “I want you to lick my balls” versus “Lick my balls” are both equally effective as long as you both say them with a commanding presence.

As long as “I want you to lick my balls” doesn’t come across as “Would, you please, please lick my balls if it wouldn’t offend you?” you’ll be fine.

4. How You’re Making Me Feel

The next structure is to tell your woman how she’s making you feel. Basically, you’re describing to her the sexual FEELINGS behind the actions. And to a woman, the sexual FEELINGS are often sexier than the actions.

Pacing the action and leading and commanding can be hot, but without any feelings (both dirty and tender) they can lead to mechanical, porno-style sex.

Here are some examples:

 “You make me feel so good baby”

 “You make me so hot for you”

 “It feels so good sliding my penis inside your pussy”

 “I love your touched against my skin”

 “I love being with you… I feel warm in your arms”

 “Looking into your eyes makes me feel your love”

 “I’m trying so hard to control myself right now”

 “I can’t keep my hands off of you, I want you so bad”

And so on. Especially after some dirty talk, you’ll want to go “tender” and describe your inner feelings.

Whereas action lends itself better to dirty talk, feelings lends itself better to sexy, tender bedroom talk.

5. Cold Reading Her Inner Desires

Cold reading her inner desires is sort of the mirror of “How You’re Making Me Feel”. Instead of saying how you’re feeling, you’re saying how SHE is feeling.

Pg 44

Of course, you can’t know exactly how a woman is feeling exactly (unless you’re a mind reader), but you can usually take a pretty good guess. You can also even LEAD a woman into a feeling just by telling her that that’s the feeling she’s having.

For example, cold reading her inner desires might mean telling her how much she really wants sex and how much she really wants to be dirty. Here are some examples:

 “You know you want to suck your strong man’s cock.”

 “It feels good, doesn’t it, you like that don’t you.”

 “The more you feel, the better it is and the more you want it.”

 “You like it when I touch you this way. You’re just a little slut deep down inside, aren’t you?”

 “You’re a very naughty little girl aren’t you.”

 “You enjoy to be told what to do by a man.”

 “You love watching your dirty ass ride up and down on my hard dick. That makes you so fucking hot.”

6. Ego boosts

Another language trick is the “Ego Boost”. An Ego Boost is any statement that makes a girl feel good about herself. It’s kind of like a compliment. Here are some examples.

 “I love eating your pussy it tastes so good.”

 “Whenever I’m around you I feel so sexy.”

 “Your body is so sexy. I’m so lucky to have you.”

 “I always feel so good around you.”

 “Your pretty mouth is so beautiful sucking me like that.”

 “I love the way you smell; I’m having such a hard time trying to kiss you.”

7. Affirmations

One verbal language structure is what I call “Affirmations”. This is when you get a girl to say, “Yes” to a command of yours.

For example, if you say to her, “You like sucking dick don’t you?” make sure that you get some form of agreement from her like a nod of the head or a yes. This is an affirmation and her response makes the experience more real for her.

For an even more powerful effect, especially when she doesn’t say “yes” like she means it, have her give you a double affirmation or even a triple affirmation. Each time she should agree with even more conviction that she’s a slut/nasty/horny girl or whatever. Here’s an example of a triple affirmation.

You: “You’re a very horny little girl aren’t you?

Her: “…yes…

You: “You didn’t say that with very much conviction. I want you to tell me that you’re a very horny little girl like you mean it.”

Her: “…I’m a very horny little girl...”

You: “Tell me like you mean it. Tell me how horny you are. Tell me how much you want my cock inside you’re so horny. I want to hear it.”

Her: “I’m so horny I want your cock inside of me!… please…”

Also, in the second or third affirmations avoid asking open-ended questions like, “You didn’t say that like you meant it! In what way are you horny?” She will have to think too much and it will break her highly aroused state.

Pg 45

Another example is to tease her and get her to beg for it…

Eat her out, get her hot. Don’t put it in until she asks for it. Then with your penis, just rub the opening to her vagina but don’t put it in.

Her: “Put it in”

You: “Tell me how much you want my cock inside of you”

Her: “I want it inside of me”

You: “Tell me how much you ache to have my cock inside of you”

Her: “I want it so badly”

8. Repetition

The language technique of “Repetition” is extremely powerful. Basically, by repeating commands or even individual words over and over, they can become more powerful and more sexy like the multiple thrust of a dagger. Here are some examples.

 Repetition of “I love”:

o

“I love moving my fingers through your hair… I love the way you smell… I love everything about you baby… you’re so sexy to me.”

 Repetition of “bad”:

o

“You’re feeling bad. I’m going to treat you like a bad girl… you want to be bad.”

 Repetition of “fuck you”:

o

“I’m going to fuck you… take you and fuck you… push you against the wall and fuck you.”

 Repetition as used to emphasize the importance of an action:

o

“Suck it! Come on, suck it! Suck it like you mean it!”

 Repetition of “warm”:

o

“Your kisses are so warm; your hugs are so warm; your tummy is so warm; you’re like my warm little teddy bear.”

9. Cursing

Cursing can be a useful language technique when you want to get really dirty and can be quite thrilling to a girl who might not normally curse outside of the bedroom.

Compare “That was an intense orgasm,” to “Holy shit… that was an intense orgasm.” Or, “I’m going to fucking bang you harder,” or “I’m going to fucking smack your god-damned ass,” and “Jesus, it just feels so bloody good that I want to fucking cum all over you.”





10. Push-pull


The next verbal technique is to use “Push – Pull”.


Push-pull involves you pulling her in with a little sexy or dirty talk and then pushing her away. Then you pull her in again, and so on.

Say to her for instance, “Hmmm, I want to pull your panties off and eat you out right here… no I shouldn’t do that, that would be so wrong.”

Or say to her, “Hmmm… your hair smells so nice… no stop that, I have work to do… don’t turn me on right now… then again, your skin feels so soft and yummy…”

You can do push-pull with purely physical motions as well. Start groping her, kissing her, and then playfully push her away. Her reaction will naturally be to jump back on you. Kiss her and grope her some more, and then push her off of you like you need to get some work done. Be playful.

Pg 46





How dirty is too dirty?

Now we all have to keep in mind that your idea of “dirty” may be different than your woman’s.

For example, if she says, “Talk dirty to me,” and you say, “Suck my cock, you filthy little whore,” she may freak out because what she wanted to hear was, “I love your delicious pussy juices, honey.”

If she says “Tell me about your wildest fantasy,” and you say, “Piss all over me,” she may freak out because what she wanted to hear was, “I want to lick whipped cream off your nipples.” So start your dirty talk out as PG-13 and gauge your woman’s reaction before getting into the really nasty talk.

Also, don’t confuse your woman’s fantasies with what she’ll actually go through in real life.

Even if she describes a fantasy to you of getting gangbanged by bunch of construction workers while enjoying sexual intercourse with you, that doesn’t mean she’ll go through with a gangbang in real life. In your arms she knows she’s safe and secure while avoiding the complications that would result if being served by several men actually happened.





Chapter 4: Voice


Animal Sounds Game


Besides words, sounds and moans like “uuhh”, “ahhh”, “ohhh”, and “mmm” are sexy and exciting too.

Unfortunately, too often we just lay back inside our own heads and take in the pleasure without giving the woman any verbal indication of what’s going on. You don’t necessarily have to say, “That feels so nice,” all the time, but you shouldn’t be a mute either. An “ooh” or “ahh” will often suffice.

Here’s a fun game you can play with your girl to get her making sexy noises. Because it’s not just about the sound or moan you make, but HOW you make it.

First, buy 5 or 6 small stuffed animals or Beanie Baby animals that you know what they sound like it, like a sheep, a cow, a cat, and a dog. Sheep go “baah”, cows go “moo”, cats go “meow” and dogs go “ruff”.

Bring the stuffed animals to your girl and play around with making sexy sounds as a sheep, cow, cat, or dog.

Have her say “baah” as one very naughty, moaning sheep. Then have her say “mooo” as one very naughty cow.

The trick with these sounds and moans is that you are not being loud; actually you are being quite faint. The desired outcome is for your voice to barely seep out. Technically, this is speech sound articulated by a momentary closing of the glottis in the back of your throat, hence restricting the airflow. In laymen terms, you are making a murmur sound or a loud whisper.

By the way, this is a great seduction game to play with a woman you haven’t slept with yet – as a means to get the “right thoughts” flowing through her mind!

Speaking with a Sexy Voice

What does your voice have to do with being sexy? Absolutely everything.

The male voice itself is hypnotic to women, just like the female voice is hypnotic to men. Have you ever been waiting in line for something when you heard some cute female voices coming from behind you and you instinctively turned around to look? Well, in the same way your voice can have an entrancing effect on women.

With a proper speaking voice you’ll be better able to relax your woman and put to sleep that critical part of her mind that makes judgments and resists suggestions. If the tone and quality of your voice is relaxing, deep, Pg 47

commanding, and resonant, your woman will stop, relax, listen, and assume you’re an authority. She’ll let what you’re saying enter into her mind and affect it. In other words, she will go into a trance-like state. In fact, most people are walking around in a relaxed, trance-like state ALL the time and it’s just your job to make them to listen to YOU.

Resonance

The first aspect of voice I want to discuss is resonance.

You don’t want to sound nasally or squeaky. Imagine commanding a woman to get down on her knees with a nasally voice. The power of the command would be deflated because the weakness of your voice is not congruent with the power of your words.

You want your voice to sound rich and full, soothing and warm – in other words, resonant. What you don’t want is to sound whispery and raspy, nasally and thin, or whiny and grating. A resonant voice sounds sexy and soothing, sounds like someone who is in a position of authority, while a raspy or nasally voice only signals inexperience or nervousness.

To practice speaking with resonance, make a long “uhhhhhh” sound out loud.

Where do you feel the physical vibration when you say “uhhh”? Most likely, if your resonance is poor, you’ll only feel the vibration in your throat. Touch your throat for a moment, say “uhhhh” and you’ll feel the vibration there on your fingertips. Now touch your chest and say “uhhhh” and you probably don’t feel much vibration there at all. When you speak only from your throat, you don’t get much resonance in your speaking voice.

Now try to move the vibration of the “uhhhhhh” down to your chest. You may have to play around for a while to get it there. But you’ll know you have it when you feel a strong vibration there. Your chest and throat should both have that vibration when you speak.

Listen to the difference. First, from the throat. Now from the chest and throat.

Repeat this exercise every day for a few weeks and throughout the day, monitor your speaking so that you can feel the sound vibration not just in your throat, but in your chest as well. At the same time, ask yourself throughout the day how your much resonance your voice has and adjust it.

Now try reading the following passage resonating from your chest:

“I’m taking you right now. I’m going to push you down on the bed and rip off your blouse leaving you naked from the waist down. I want to reach over and touch your thighs, run my fingers up the crack, run just one finger up between your knees as slow as I can, slow so it drives you insane, so I can watch your face while you try not to show how fucking hot this makes you. I’m going to pull your legs apart and push my dick into that hot pussy of yours. But I want to wait, I want to make it last. I’m not giving you this until you tell me how bad you want it. And when you do, you’re going to take my dick in your mouth and suck it like it’s the most delicious ice-cream cone you’ve ever eaten… until I cum and you swallow that sweetness down the back of your throat.”

Tempo

Tempo simply refers to how fast or how slowly you’re speaking.

Some people speak so fast that you have a hard time following what they’re saying. Each word gets so little emphasis that none of the words has any impact. Also, when talking fast they don’t have time to breath properly, and their words lack projection and resonance which all depends on the air flow.

Pg 48





When talking sexy and dirty, make sure to slow down and pause to break down what you’re saying into chunks that make sense. You need to slow down and pause to create powerful silences that draw attention to certain words and ideas that you’re communicating. A pause after a word gives time for the idea to sink in. If you speak too fast, the impact of your sexy and dirty talk will be lost.

Not only that, but slowing down help you e-nun-ci-ate clearly so that your listeners can pick up every word and because e-nun-c-i-at-ing clearly can be very sexy. After all, what sounds sexier… chocolate or choc-co-late?

For example, say to yourself, “You laying there naked makes me so hot for you I find you irresistible,” very quickly.

Now say it with a lot of pauses, long breaths, and enunciate every word: “You… laying there… makes me… so hot for you… I find you… irresistible.”

When you take your time is sounds more natural and less mechanical, which is the whole point of effective sexy and dirty talk.

Another little trick is to stretch out the words’ vowels, like so:

“I want to suuuck it”

“I want to liiiick it”

This puts extra emphasis of the verb action and can be quite sexy.

Now try reading the following passage with a slow tempo, pauses, long breaths, all while resonating from your chest:

“I’m taking you right now. I’m going to push you down on the bed and rip off your blouse leaving you naked from the waist down. I want to reach over and touch your thighs, run my fingers up the crack, run just one finger up between your knees as slow as I can, slow so it drives you insane, so I can watch your face while you try not to show how fucking hot this makes you. I’m going to pull your legs apart and push my dick into that hot pussy of yours. But I want to wait, I want to make it last. I’m not giving you this until you tell me how bad you want it. And when you do, you’re going to take my dick in your mouth and suck it like it’s the most delicious ice-cream cone you’ve ever eaten… until I cum and you swallow that sweetness down the back of your throat.”





Chapter 5: Themes


Sexy talk in normal settings


Dirty and sexy talk is not just for the bedroom. Dirty talk can start BEFORE you get into bed. Remember that sexy and dirty talk is about building TENSION. Get in the habit of talking sexy and dirty BEFORE you get her clothes off.

For example, you could phone her and talk sexy to her while she’s working. Say to her while she’s in the office,

“Hmm, I was just thinking about you… how hot you were last night… tomorrow I’m going to dress you up in some sexy white lingerie which you’re going to wear tomorrow.”

Or around the house catch her off guard and whisper into her ear, "Later tonight I'm going to kiss and nibble your neck and run my tongue along your nipples."

If she calls you on the phone and asks what you’ve been doing you can tell her, “Well, I just took a hot shower and jerked off while thinking about fucking you.”

Pg 49

This sort of verbal foreplay will set her heart racing with anticipation. Learn to talk dirty to her during anytime of the day and in any situation.

So remember to use sexy and dirty talk to BUILD over time sexual TENSION. Build that delicious tension, that longing, that anticipation, that electricity, that anticipation.

Think of it as TEASING.

Give her a little fantasy, then pull back. Then give her a little more, then pull back.

Keep teasing and building tension until she literally wants to rape you.

Don’t rush your verbal teasing. Take yourself out of the “instant gratification” mindset if you want to drive her crazy. Remain in control. Building that sexual tension takes time. Keep the pace slow, steady and deliberate.

For example, talk sexy to her over the phone. When you see her at home, slap her ass, kiss her, and pull back.

Tell her how good you’re going to give it to her a little later on.

This is all about building the sexual tension.

When it’s time, grab her and push her against the wall. Say something sexy or dirty to her. Don’t take off her clothes – yet. Instead, grind (dry hump) her through your clothes.

By the time her pants off, lick AROUND her pussy and tell her how much you like licking her there. And so on.

Being the aggressor

Women like a man who is the aggressor in bed; the kind of man that leads and takes charge. It fits in with women’s whole fantasy of SURRENDER to a force that’s greater than herself, of her LOSING CONTROL to a more dominant, powerful man.

Be commanding and don’t ask whether she wants you to do everything little thing. Just do it. Being the dominant aggressor means being aggressive in your wants and desires. Being the dominant aggressor means taking charge, commanding and even demanding - “I am going to handcuff you to the bed, and you better not squeal… spread your legs.”

Some women in new relationships are all about testing. If you tell her to suck you off, she might say, “Well, what if I say no?” Hold your ground and tell her to do it. Don’t start pleading or begging, this looks very wussy.

An extension of being the aggressor is the RAVISH FANTASY.

A lot of women have a fantasy about being raped. This doesn’t mean that they really want to be raped in real life, but they have a fantasy about being so desired that the man can’t control himself and RAVISHES her.

When you both have your clothes on, grind her and grab her like you can’t take your hand off her. Tell her how are it is too control yourself with her. Tell her, “Oh god… I’m trying so hard not to fuck you right here right now.”

The theme here is losing your self-control that you have to ravish her. Then in bed, get a little rough. Roughly undress her. Pull her hair. Grab her breasts hard. Kiss her all over. Fuck her hard. Ravish her.

Describe a forbidden fantasy

One way to expand your range of sexy talk is to frame it within a fantasy. For example, you can tell your woman a forbidden fantasy while you make love to her. For example: Pg 50

 Describe how you’ll make her suck you off in the middle of a movie theatre.

 Describe how you’ll dress her in a short skirt and make her bend over in front of some strangers in a convenience store.

 Describe how you’ll dress her up as a prostitute and how she’ll show up at your door. You’ll then take her in and treat her like a high-class hooker.

 Describe how you’ll light candles all around the bath tub, fill the water with scented soap and bubbles, and make love to her in the water.

 Describe taking her to a club and picking up some guy that she thinks is cute and having him bang her as you watch.

 Describe how next time you’re alone with her in the car you’ll do her there.

Remember to DESCRIBE the fantasy. Use DETAILS. Be as vivid as possible to make it seem more real in her mind.

For example, “Suck my cock baby!” is not very vivid. But, “Take my hard cock and let it slowly slide in and out of your hot wet mouth until some of that excess saliva which hangs between your tongue and the tip of my cock finally snaps and lands on your face ,” describes a lot more detail.

The slut archetype

Women have to act like Madonnas to everyone in public, but that’s not how they want to be treated in the bedroom. A fun little sexy talk pattern is to explicitly speak this dynamic into the bedroom.

For example you might say to her, “To everyone else you act like such a nice, innocent girl… but I know that deep inside you’re just a horny cocksucking slut who likes to be talked dirty to. If only they all knew what a little slut you really were inside.”

Or a lighter version would be, “I know how you always act like a good girl to all of your co-workers and friends… but I know that you’re not really like that. Deep inside you want it bad… deep inside you want to be treated like the naughty little girl you are… deep inside you want to put your mouth on my cock.”

Women get turned on when you directly contrast her outer Madonna that the world normally sees to her inner slut.

FEEL what you’re saying

Remember, it’s not only about WHAT you say but HOW you say it. Focus your mind on how much you enjoy sex with the girl, how your body tingles with excitement when she touches you, and how aroused you get when she gives you pleasure. Let your words be backed up with genuine FEELING. If you tell her she has a nice ass, FEEL that she has a nice ass through your whole body. If you tell her she looks so sweet, FEEL how sweet she looks.

If your words are packed with congruent emotion behind them, they’ll come across as much more powerful.

Involve her

A lot of times you’ll be speaking a lot of sexy and dirty talk and the girl won’t respond in kind. She’s enjoying it, it just hasn’t crossed her mind to participate. She’s mute.

While having sex ask tell her to talk dirty to you. Most likely she’ll jump in, but if she’s a bit shy or doesn’t know how then tell her what to say. On the other hand if she does talk dirty back and you like what she is saying, follow along with it.

Pg 51





Winding down / tender talk

A good way to wind down hot sexy talk or dirty talk and after the sex is over is to switch to “tender talk” or the

“whispering of sweet nothings into her ear”. So this is just a way of acknowledging that it’s over and you’re coming out of that role. The contrast between aggressive hot talk with sweet talk can drive a woman absolutely crazy and in love (so be careful with this technique… the girl may never want to leave you).

For example, you can end the dirty talk with some “love you” whisper follow-ups in her ear or say something like, “I love how I can be myself with you… I love you.”

The point is don’t be calling her a slut or a whore, finish, and just walk away!

Sex Blitz 2: Sexy Things to Say in Bed (Dirty Talk and Emotional Talk)

Question from a reader:

Hi Dan,

I saw you speak at a lair meeting not too long ago, and I’ve gotta say that I learned a ton from your presentation. I plan on buying a copy of your e-book when the second release comes, and I’m looking forward to seeing the video from the presentation on your site.

I have a question on sex that I thought you could answer. You briefly talked about dirty talk, emotional talk, and combining the two during the presentation. Could you explain a little more about sexy things to say in bed, and how to start if you’ve never done it? I’m 33 and never been very vocal in bed, and I’m finding that I’m having a hard time starting.

Thanks a bunch Dan, and I look forward to reading your book.

My Reply:

Glad you enjoyed my presentation, and thanks for the email.

What you say while you’re in bed is a very important, and I wish I had more time to talk about it at the lair meeting. Bedroom talk is a fundamental piece of my system, so it’s important that you understand and use it if you want to achieve sexual mastery.

Why is what you say in bed so important? Remember, the First Principle of Sexuality, which states that how you excite a woman psychologically is more important than how you excite her physically. Bedroom talk enhances sex by directly providing this psychological stimulation.

When you have mastered bedroom talk, you’ll be able to turn your girlfriend on and make her want sex just by speaking in her ear. While you’re having sex with her, you’ll able to make the sex many times better with just a few words.

Obviously, bedroom talk is very powerful and shouldn’t be ignored.

The first and most important element of dirty talk is your tonality. It should be deep and dominant, like that of a hypnotist. It should be passionate, yet controlled. Your control over your voice is important – it is very dominant and a huge turn on for woman to be deliriously senseless with pleasure, while you maintain absolute control.

This is more difficult than it sounds, because the natural instinct when you are very aroused is to lose control of your voice. With practice though, you will be able to maintain control of your voice even during the most powerful orgasm.

Pg 52

Once you’ve mastered your bedroom tonality, you should begin to actively work on your dirty talk. Dirty talk is basically anything that makes sex better by making her feel more dominated.

In The Sex Revolution Handbook, I don’t supply you with many specific canned dirty talk “lines” to use in bed.

Every situation is different, and the exact words you say are not important as long as your dirty talk is along the right lines.

Instead, what I do is supply you with four themes to concentrate your dirty talk around, and examples of how to use each theme.

For example, one theme to concentrate your dirty talk around is possession. Although no woman will tell you this, at times they all want to be treated like an object in the bedroom. Not all the time, but sometimes (this is where variety comes in – too much of a good thing can be a bad thing).

There are many ways you can arouse your woman with the possession theme in bed. When you’re fucking her, don’t just call her a slut or a whore. This can be good, but it’s much more effective if you say “you’re my slut,”

or “you’re my whore.” The added theme of possession enhances any dirty name that you might want to call her.

While you’re fucking her and she’s extremely turned on, start talking dirty in her each about how she belongs to you. Tell her “you’re all mine…your pussy belongs to me” as you’re fucking her so hard she’s helpless to respond. Make her look in your eyes and say that she’s all yours as you make her cum. This is priceless – her orgasm will be much more intense if you can dominate her like this.

These are just a few things you can do – the Handbook includes many more techniques for arousing her with possession and the other three variety themes.

Now dirty talk is great, but it’s not the only type of talking that you should be doing in bed. In addition to talking dirty to turn her on with dominance, you should also be using emotional talk to turn her on with the second dimension in the DEVI system, emotion.

Sex is the most intensely emotional act we are capable of, and heightened emotions always make for better sex.

The interesting this is, it does not matter what kind of emotion it is that she’s feeling – it just matters that the emotion is strong.

Mostly I will use positive emotions (love, connection, closeness, etc.) to emotionally arouse a girl. Occasionally though, I will also use negative emotions. You have to be careful with these though – if you use negative emotions in the wrong way in the bedroom it will make her insecure and unable to fully let herself go during sex. However, when used in the right way these negative emotions will enhance sex just as much as positive ones.

There are three main themes you should concentrate your emotional talk around to establish positive emotions of connection. In addition to this, you can make sex better by verbally teasing a woman – temporarily giving her negative emotions of being deprived so that you can later gratify her.

You should do both emotional and dirty talk in bed – both are effective by themselves, but they are even more effective when combined. Talking to her dirty one time you have sex, and emotionally the next will make both sexual experiences better.

The best though, is when you can combine both dirty talk and emotional talk by doing them both simultaneously.

Pg 53





Here is one way to do this: say something dirty to her while manhandling her (a physical way to increase dominance). Then, immediately follow it up with something emotional.

For example, when she is having sex with you and about to have an orgasm: Girl: Dan, you can’t make me cum…that’s bad…

Dan: Shut up (spanks her hard, manhandles her legs apart and starts fucking her harder) Dan: I love my baby…I would never hurt my baby (keeps talking emotionally like this to her through her orgasm).

As you can see, the rules of logic decidedly do not apply in bedroom talk. When she is very aroused, she will not be thinking logically about whether what you are saying makes sense – she will only know that you are fulfilling both her need for dominance and emotion at the same time. Although this type of talk is full of logical contradictions, it is the most effective way of talking to a girl in bed.

Now this is great, but how do you start talking dirty in bed if you’ve never done it before?

Start when she is very aroused – preferably when she is near orgasm. When she is turned on enough, she won’t object to anything you say. Start with moderately dirty and emotional talk (you’re a dirty little girl, I care about you so much, etc.)

If you’ve never talked in this way before, you’ll have this irrational fear that she’ll just sit bolt upright in the middle of her orgasm and say “No, I am not a dirty little girl!” After you’ve done dirty and emotional talk for a while though, you’ll realize how ridiculous this is. Remember, get her aroused enough and she won’t object to anything.

Once you’ve done dirty talk when she’s really aroused, you can start working it into sex earlier and earlier.

After a while, you’ll be able to talk dirty and emotionally even before you start having sex with a girl. And you won’t be restricted to the mild stuff that you have to use at first either – as your relationship with the girl progresses, you’ll be able to do heavier stuff which isn’t appropriate at first. This stuff will really take your sex life to the next level.

Sex Revolution Handbook

Act 2 : Dominance

Dirty Talk

Sex is much better when you incorporate dirty talk into it. Once you’re used to talking dirty to your partner and have her talking dirty back, you’ll marvel that you were ever silent during sex.

Even when you’re not talking dirty, it is important that you be vocal during sex. Think about it, what gives you more sexual pleasure: a girl who moans and screams in pleasure as you fuck her or a girl who is silent and still as a corpse? Don’t be afraid to let out passionate noises in bed. Remove your inhibitions – you will find that once you do, you’ll naturally want to moan when you enter her, and let out a roar when you reach orgasm.

Once you’re comfortable making passionate noises, you should start talking dirty. The tonality that you use when you’re talking dirty is very important. It should be deep and dominant, like the voice of a hypnotist. It should be passionate, but controlled. Train yourself to maintain control of your voice, even at high levels of arousal. Your voice should also be devoid of all nervousness and uncertainty. A dominant male does not talk with hesitation, nor does he look for approval before continuing his dirty talk. He just does it.

Pg 54

The best time to talk dirty is when she is very aroused. Ideally, this will be when you are having sex with her.

The very best is when you are giving her so much pleasure that she is helpless to make any response. When you have mastered the art of dirty talk, you will be able to fill hear ear with a controlled, hypnotic stream of erotic language even while you’re railing the shit out of her with everything you have.

The first few times you have sex with a new woman, start calling her a dirty little girl. Tell her how wet her pussy is, and how good it feels to be fucking her. After she’s become somewhat comfortable with you, start talking dirty more when she’s very aroused.

There are five main themes that you should concentrate your dirty talk around.

Some of the best dirty talk comes from a real understanding of female sexuality. Women go to their jobs and look proper all day, pretending that they’re thinking about platonic things. Even when guys approach them, women have to pretend that they’re not interested in sex because of social conditioning. This is torture for them, because women are more sexually obsessed than men. Not only do they think about sex more, but the thoughts are more intense because they try to repress them. However, hardly any men have the insight to see that beneath their platonic façades, all women crave sex.

When she’s very aroused, tell her that you know how much she thinks about sex. Say that she pretends she doesn’t want to get fucked all day, but you know what a slut she is on the inside. Tell her you know that she thinks about your cock inside her all day. She’ll protest and give you a token “no…I’m a good girl…” but don’t pay attention.

Tell her that her pussy gets wet when she even thinks about your cock inside her. Tell her how wet she is right now, that’s she’s dripping all over your cock.

Personalizing your dirty talk like this will make it even better. Whenever you can, you should always call her YOUR slut or YOUR whore, rather than just calling her a slut or a whore.

This has a threefold effect. First, she feels more dominated if you imply that you possess her like this. Second, the motif of being yours adds to the emotion that she feels. And finally, any insecurities that may be triggered by your talking dirty to her like this will be reduced by personalizing your dirty talk. Because she is yours, she doesn’t have to worry as much about you being one of those guys that is so screwed up by social programming that he is secretly disgusted by women who respond to dirty talk.

In fact, possession is so important that it should be a theme by itself of your dirty talk. When you’re fucking her, tell her that her pussy is yours, and that you own her pussy. If she gives you a token “nooo…” then say “really….then why is your little pussy getting so wet for me? I think you are my pussy…” and keep fucking her harder.

Telling her how excited you are for her is also great. Tell her that you’ve been thinking about fucking her all day – that you get hard just thinking about tearing her wet little pussy up. Tell her what you’re going to do to her – that you’re going to fuck her so deep and so hard and make her cum all over you.

Being under your control is also very exciting for a woman. Tell her that she’s yours, and that you’re going to fuck her anytime you want. Tell her that she’s always going have your cock in her pussy and that she’s going to take your cum inside her every day. Make her call you master. Make her say “yes, master” when you tell her to do things.

When she’s about to cum, tell her to cum for you like a good little slut, and she’ll say “yes, master!” If she waffles or refuses to say “yes master,” make her. Fuck her harder while you’re holding her throat gently but Pg 55





firmly, or even slap her moderately hard across the face (this is advanced – don’t do this until she’s highly converted and accepting of your other dominant behaviour in bed!) Although dirty talk can be a very powerful tool, your girlfriend will begin to react negatively towards it if it is the only kind of talking you do in bed. It’s important for you to combine dirty talk with emotional talk – the two are not mutually exclusive. Rather, they enhance each other when used at the same time. After sex, it is also important that you talk emotionally to her, hold her, and tell her how much she means to you. This will alleviate any fears that your girl may have that you won’t respect her if she responds to her dirty talk, and preserve her immersion.

Act 2 : Emotion

Combining Dirty Talk With Emotional Talk

Although both dirty talk and emotional talk work wonders in isolation, they are most effective in tandem.

You should almost always combine dirty and emotional talk, and rarely go through a session of sex without doing some of each.

Don’t worry about making smooth “transitions” between the dirty and emotional talk, or even about making sense when you are combining the two. It does not matter if it would make sense to her in a objective, logical state of mind – you will be saying these things when she is in a highly aroused state. In this state of mind, what you are saying will make perfect sense to her as it mirrors her own chaotic cravings and feelings.

When in bed, here is how I will typically talk:

------

Spirit Fingers: (fingering the girl) “You’re really wet for me…you must have been thinking about getting fucked all day. You’re my wet little pussy, and I’m going to fuck the shit out of you” (throws her on the bed, gets her turned on by eating her out, and starts fucking her)

Spirit Fingers: (said in a deep, hypnotic voice while fucking her hard) “Baby, I’m inside you…I love you so much baby…this little pussy’s so tight, I’m going to have to tear it apart. I’m going to have to fuck the shit out of you…”

Girl: (giving weak token resistance while getting fucked) noo…my pussy’s too tight for that…

Spirit Fingers: “Shut the fuck up (grabs her throat and fucks her harder). I wouldn’t hurt my baby…I love my baby so much…”

-----------------------

Saying “I love you” in one breath, calling her your slut in the next, saying that you would never hurt her while you grasp her throat and fuck the shit out of her…this is the essence of a sexual master’s bedroom talk. The rules of logic do not apply; the rules of emotion reign supreme. With every word you contradict yourself, and with every word she gets more turned on. In her pleasure distorted state she only understands that you are fulfilling her need to be dominated and her need for strong emotions at the same time. That is all that matters.

Act 3 : The Revolution Archives

Various extracts

----------------------------

The Moment of Penetration

There are four main ways to penetrate a girl for the first time.

2. The second way is to do little foreplay. You want to do enough to get the pussy moist, but not dripping wet (you have to be confident in your ability to make her cum with your dick alone). It should be dry enough so that it is difficult for you to put it in her. Grab your dick in your hand to anchor it, and slowly force your dick inside her inch by inch.

Say things like “Wow…your pussy is so fucking tight…but I’m just going to fuck it anyways.” Don’t say this like a horny schoolboy – say it in a slow, dominant tonality. It will be slightly painful for you, and more painful for her, but this is a good thing. It is dominant pain – even though it is bad physically, it is very dominant psychologically which makes up for it. Remember, the theme of this method of entrance is that her pussy is so tight that it’s difficult for you to even enter her, but you’re forcing your way into her anyways – very exciting for the girl. This isn’t something that you want to do all the time, but it’s great if you do it once in a while.

4. The fourth and final technique is the most powerful. It introduces even stronger emotions into the sex than the previous one. You have to be careful with it though, because while the previous technique utilizes mainly positive emotions, this technique utilizes negative emotions. These negative emotions are just as effective as positive ones in producing sexual pleasure, but have to be managed carefully – too much negative emotion and the girl will start to get filled with insecurities and distracting thoughts, lowering her level of immersion in the sex.

What you want to do is tease her mercilessly until she begs for you to fuck her. At first, rub your dick on her pussy. Ask her “do you want to get fucked?” She’ll be hesitant to say yes, but after you tease her enough eventually she will. When she does, put the head of your cock inside her to reward her. Tell her “Alright …

but I don’t think you can take my whole cock. I’ll give you just a little bit.” If you’ve had good sex with you before, she’ll wail that she can handle it all, and probably try to shove it inside her. Don’t let her – progress slowly, going an inch or half inch deeper only as a reward for her begging for it. When you’ve almost penetrated her fully, suddenly withdraw your cock all the way from her. Hold it right against the entrance to her pussy, and tell her “I don’t know about this…you’re only a little girl, I don’t think you can take all of my cock inside you.” If you’ve done it right, at this point, she’ll start crying and begging you to fuck her.

Let her do this for a few seconds, then plunge your dick inside her all at once. Because she had such strong (negative) emotions, it will feel incredible for her. Fuck her hard, and she should cum very soon.

----------------------------

Sex Positions

When And Why To Change Positions

Instead, you should change positions at the time that maximizes both of your sexual pleasure. That sound vague, so let me lay it out:

•

Change positions when you want to add dominance. Give dominant commands to get her into these positions. Instead of saying “let’s do doggy style,” say “I want you to get on your hands and knees so I can fuck your little pussy from behind.”

Pg 57





Anal Sex

If you’re getting objections at this point, or she asks you what you’re doing, handle it by maintaining your dominance. Don’t start explaining your actions or talking logically, just tell her in a matter of fact way what you are doing. Say “I’m playing with your nice ass baby,” and keep doing it. Keep eating her out or fucking her too

– if she’s aroused enough, she won’t be in the state of mind to make any objections.

….

Keep fucking her doggy style until you can feel that she’s about to cum. Take her right to the brink, then intensify your anal stimulation. When she’s right on the edge – stop. Take your dick out of her pussy, and press it against her ass. Say “baby…I’m going to fuck you up the ass.”

----------------------------

When She Comes

A female orgasm is a beautiful thing. Once you’ve got her there, you want to take her from having a great orgasm to having an extraordinary one.

…

If you wish to make the orgasm a dominant one, command her to cum for you. Tell her, “Cum for me baby…cum for me” as she’s getting near, and keep repeating it, hypnotically, until she does.

Even better, once you’ve established a high level of trust in the relationship, you can command her to cum for you and tell her that there is nothing that she can do about it. Step up the dirty talk for this one. If you have the prerequisite trust she’ll love it. As she’s getting closer and closer, whisper in her ear “Look at how wet you are, you little slut…you’re dripping all over me. I’m going to make you cum like a whore all over my cock, and there’s nothing you can do about it.” The idea is to try and make her resist and hold back the orgasm (negative emotion and dominance). Of course, by this point she will not be able to, and by trying to hold it back, the orgasm will only become more intense.

----------------------------

Achieving Simultaneous Orgasm

…

Say “Baby, are you about to cum for me?” After she says yes, tell her to tell you when she’s about to cum. Keep fucking her until she gets to that point. Pay attention to how her body is responding, and you should be able to sense how close she is.

How Dominance Can Be a TURN OFF In Bed

Pretty much every guy knows that he SHOULD be talking dirty to his girl in bed, that it is exciting for her. He knows that he should be spanking her, manhandling her, giving her the male Dominance that every woman craves.

HOWEVER…there is a big difference between KNOWING IT, and ACTUALLY DOING IT.

Pg 58





Deep down, all of us have a fear of talking dirty or dominating a woman. The fear that she’ll get offended. The fear that we’ll get nervous and sound like an idiot. The fear of sexual rejection.

As much as we don’t want to admit it, this fear is POWERFUL. If left unchecked, it can preclude a lot of your sexual excitement and ruin your sex life.

So, how can we conquer this fear of Dominance, and start having better sex?

There are four main ways to overcome this fear that I discuss in The Sexual Confidence Bootcamp. One of these ways is to know exactly what types of dirty talk and Dominance WILL offend a woman, and turn her off.

Don’t get me wrong — dirty talk done the right way will be tremendously exciting for a woman. But if you do it the wrong way, it can be a turn off.

It’s like if you have to run through a field in the fastest time possible. Obviously, you want to just START

confidently and run through without hesitation.

But, what if there were a few land mines hidden in the field that you didn’t know about? You’d probably run MUCH slower, because you’d be terrified about setting off one of the hidden land mines.

Knowing what dirty talk turns a woman off is like knowing where these land mines are. You can be confident that you’re steering way clear of them, and thus your worry and anxiety will be reduced tremendously.

There are FIVE of these types of dirty talk and Dominance that turn a woman off.

The first is dirty talk or Dominance that is ABUSIVE. It is VERY, VERY rare that any guy does this to a woman, but it is important to know nonetheless.

Remember, the purpose of dirty talk is not to degrade or insult that woman. It is to arouse her with Dominance.

For example, “You’re MY dirty little slut,” said when said while holding a woman in your arms in looking deep into her eyes is Dominant, and will arouse her.

“You’re a stupid bitch,” is neither Dominant nor arousing. It’s merely annoying and insulting.

Of course, this is an extreme example, but you get the idea. If you start making your dirty talk abusive, women will SHUT DOWN any arousal that they feel with you. Not just when you are abusive, but all the time. Not to mention, it’s also morally fucked up.

If you are talking dirty to her in order to AROUSE her, and not ABUSE her, however, you won’t run into any trouble with this.

I’ll talk about two more of the ways that you can screw up and actually turn off a woman with Dominance in:

Using Sex To Prevent Drama By Qball

4. Using sex in the relationship

The best way to deal with drama is to prevent it from happening in the first place. Usually you can tell (if you’re aware and sensitive enough) to slight changes in the girl’s behaviour – times when she changes from her baseline. Now you have to think to yourself: “Is this drama caused from a lack in value or a lack in comfort?”

Pg 59





4.4. The importance of talk – emotional talk and dirty talk This is not to be underestimated. If sex is a story, the talking is the soundtrack. Making sounds in general is important, and if you’re not a loud lover, become one. But dirty talk and emotional talk have a very powerful function too. The more someone is emotional, the easier it is to affect their subconscious. And since sex is such a strong emotional experience for a girl, when you talk to them during sex, you’re talking to their subconscious.

The messages you say in these moments of passion remain etched in her subconscious very powerfully – even if (and this is very common) she won’t remember what you said specifically during sex. So, make the messages very value/comfort related – even in a very direct way – this will work both to turn a girl more and for your longer term goals.

Examples for very direct dirty talk:

“Baby, you’ve been thinking about fucking me all night long. You’re such a dirty little slut.. You love having this big cock inside of you, pounding you like you’re a piece of meat. You love servicing this cock (if she rides you) and making your man come. You need me so much, baby – I give you so much pleasure. No other man can fuck you like this”

Examples of very direct emotional talk:

“Baby, I love you so much. Having my cock inside you, I feel how much you care for me, and I care so much for you too. I’ll always have your back baby (hold her close), and I’ll never let anyone harm you. I’ll always keep you safe baby. I’ll keep fucking you forever baby, giving you all this pleasure baby”

A quick tip to reinforce her sexual attraction for you after sex, to ensure that she wants sex even more the next time.

If you’re having sex the right way, you’re going to be very sweaty, there’s going to be a lot of bodily fluids lying round on the bed. This is good because it’s a sign that was good sex. But one side effect of this, is that it can be a little uncomfortable after sex like this, to be lying there in the midst of all the bodily fluids, it can ruin the afterglow for her.

However if you do this, she can fully enjoy the afterglow. In your bathroom you want to have two bath-towels ready at all times. After sex, go into the bathroom and soak the towels in warm water, wring them out so they’re not too wet and then go back to her.

Without saying anything, turn her over and wash off her body with the face-cloth. This is going to feel very good for her and it’s going to show her that you really care about her after the sex. This is especially important after you’ve had sex that was very dominant or incorporated a lot of dirty talk, because she’s going to wonder if you still care about her after you said all those things.

So if you do this tip, she’s going to be much more receptive to doing these things and going even further with you the next time.

Pg 60





Do keep in mind the principle of sexual compliance. You want to make sure that no matter how nice you are to her, that you’re not doing more work to have sex with her, than she is doing to have sex with you.

So if you were to do this technique of wiping her down, that might fall into that category. So to prevent that you want to add this part onto the end of the technique. After you wash her body, without saying anything put the towel in her hands, lay down and look at her expecting her to wash you. If it was great sex she’ll do it every time.

This will create an experience where she’s both enjoying it, she feels that you care about her and you’re getting a lot of sexual compliance out of her because she’s washing you. So this way she’s enjoying it even more and wanting to have sex the next time too.

Sex Report # 1 : Giving Her The Continuously Orgasmic State

11/21/2008

Background

I’d met this girl in the mall about two months before this happened, and began our relationship by sleeping with her within a few days. This was accomplished by:

 Confidence in my own attractiveness (Sexual Confidence) which I gained mainly from the knowledge that I was great in bed. Most guys would get nervous approaching a random hot girl in the mall and asking for her phone number, but after seeing girls cum over and over again on my cock while begging for me to fuck them…getting nervous about talking to a girl in the mall seemed a little silly.

She was half Japanese and half white, and almost my exact physical type. She had an amazingly beautiful face and a great body, although a little skinnier than I typically like. Her hair was also amazing – I can remember it felt incredibly soft and silky, silkier than any other girl’s hair that I’ve ever felt.

We had been dating nonexclusively for about two months before I put her in the Continuously Orgasmic State.

Keys To Pleasure

 Being the guy she fantasized about before sex began – getting her wanting to have sex with me hours in advance of it actually happening.

 Escalation of more and more intense sex throughout the two previous months of the relationship

 Giving her an orgasm through oral sex before intercourse started to get a “head start” on the Continuously Orgasmic State.

 Shapeshifting – giving her many different types of psychological stimulation

 Having enough sexual stamina to give her constant stimulation when she reached the Continuously Orgasmic State.

Before Sex

That night, she invited me to go to a bar with a few of her friends. She had a pretty cool social circle – other attractive girls who were also into fashion, and a few guys.

I decided that this could be an opportunity to really take our sex life to the next level – and decided to start the whole process now. Rather than falling into the mentality that most guys do – that seduction is over when she has sex with you for the first time – I decided to “re-seduce” her tonight and really build her attraction to a fever pitch to set up some great sex.

Pg 61

Throughout the night, I focused on being the guy that she fantasized about. I talked to other groups and made friends, and well as befriending the people in her circle. I flirted with a few of her female friends – then came back to her and gave her a kiss. Basically, I let her fantasize about me from a distance when she saw me with others – then came back to her, and gave her lots of good emotions.

We started kissing, and she asked me if I wanted to go back to her house to make pumpkin pie (it had come up in conversation earlier). I told her that I did, and we left.

Foreplay

When we got back to her apartment, somehow the pumpkin pie was forgotten ;) She brought me back in, and I sat on her bed. I sat her on my lap, and she started kissing me. It escalated, quickly becoming more and more passionate – I could feel that she’d been thinking about sex for a while now.

She started kissing down my body, then unzipped my pants. I was already hard from the kissing before, and it drove me crazy even more to see her beautiful little face looking up at me from her knees. She took my cock into her mouth, and started giving me one of the greatest blowjobs of my life.

This girl actually wasn’t naturally good at giving oral sex – I had to train her in the months before with gentle guidance combined with showing her how much I enjoying it. Now though, she was a pro – teasing me before she started, giving me lots of variety through using her tongue and sucking, and driving me wild by looking up at me, and giving me a great view of my cock inside her pretty little mouth.

After a few minutes of this, I threw her on the bed and started kissing her. I quickly stripped all her clothes off, besides her panties. These I removed slowly, revealing her perfect shaved pussy, already wet for me.

She was breathing hard out of excitement – and nervousness. She was completely naked and vulnerable to me, and she could see my cock hard and erect, ready to fuck her.

At this point though, I sensed that she wasn’t 100% comfortable to be giving herself so completely to a guy who she had only known for a few months. Teasing her with my cock touching her pussy, I told her “it’s OK…you can trust me.”

I started kissing her body, allowing her to fully relaxed and get Immersed in the sexual experience. Although I could have fucked her right then, I knew if I waited and let her get more Immersed the sex would be much better later. Only once I sensed that she was completely relaxed – that she was completely consumed in the sexual pleasure and had forgotten all her self-consciousness – did I start kissing my way down to her vagina.

She was already dripping wet, and I breathed hotly on her pussy to tease her further. She was thrusting her hips up into my face, but I only gave her the lightest of stimulation at first, barely touching my tongue to her clit. She tried to grind it harder against my tongue, but I wouldn’t let her, torturing her with teasing light stimulation until she was going crazy. Then I pulled her legs up…and without warning I plunged my tongue inside her.

She shuddered and moaned as I tongue fucked her. Then, I started to lick and suck on her clit. Using finesse and my knowledge of her individual sensitivities, I started licking and sucking on it. I knew it drove her wild when I sucked her clit into my mouth and licked it with my tongue – so I did that interspersed with a variety of licking strokes, sucking, and plunging my tongue inside her. This is key – every woman has their own individual preferences for oral sex, and they all need a variety of stimulation to cum. Mix in her favorite types with the other tools in your oral sex arsenal, and you’ll be able to give any woman an orgasm.

Pg 62

And because she was so comfortable, this approach worked like magic on. With no inhibitions holding her back, she became more and more turned on, moaning louder and louder as she thrust her hips up against my face. Finally, she braced herself by grabbing the sheets and told me “Oh my god…I’m going to cum!” I held her hips in place and kept licking her with no let up until she screamed in orgasm.

I kept licking her for a few minutes afterwards, allowing her to come down – then I kissed her, allowing her to taste her own pussy.

Sex

She was breathing hard, and looked completely vulnerable. I looked into her eyes as I rubbed my cock on her pussy, which was dripping wet from her orgasm. Maintaining eye contact the entire time I penetrated her – her eyes rolled back in pleasure as she felt my cock inside of her.

I started making love to her very emotionally, slowly thrusting in and out of her while I kissed her softly. “I love being inside you,” I told her, “I love how you’re so vulnerable to me while I’m fucking you.”

“I love having you inside me,” she said as she kissed my neck.

I kept making love to her emotionally for a few more minutes, then I increased the pace of my thrusting. I looked into her eyes, and asked her “baby…do you belong to me? Are you all mine?”

She was getting close to an orgasm. “I’m all yours,” she said, breathing harder.

“Am I the only one who can be inside you?”

“You’re the only one,” she said.

“Cum for me baby,” I said. “Show me how much you need me.”

I kept thrusting into her until she came all over me.

Then, I suddenly transitioned to more dominant sex. “I love how you cum all over my cock like a little slut, baby.” I told her. “It turns me on so much when you say your pussy belongs to me.”

Now, she didn’t actually hear me say that because she was too consumed by the pleasure at this point to really notice that.

I flipped her over, and manhandled her into the doggy style position. Shoving her face down into the pillow, I mounted her from the back.”

“You’re mine,” I told her as I fucked her from behind. “You belong to me. Your pussy is MINE!” I shouted as I grabbed her hips and started fucking her with everything I had. She screamed into the pillow.

I kept talking dirty to her as I fucked her doggy style, until she had another tremendous orgasm all over my cock.

Now, I sensed that this was my first opportunity to put this girl into the Continuously Orgasmic State. She was cumming for me easier than I had ever seen her, and she was completely open to me – nothing was holding her back now.

Pg 63

I turned her over again, and started having sex with her missionary style. I knew that this was when I had to bring it home – to provide her with continuous fucking and psychological stimulation until her orgasms started to blend together.

Using Sexual Jiu Jitsu, I began “thrusting” into her by taking her body, and moving her back onto my cock.

Using this method of stimulation combined with some actual thrusting for variety, I was able to last as long as I wanted to.

I started moving her up and down rapidly on my cock, and she started screaming loudly in pleasure again. She came for a fourth time – and this time I didn’t let up at all, fucking her hard right through her orgasm while also whispering dirty or emotional talk in her ear.

I was starting to feel the physical fatigue in the muscles of my core, but I didn’t let up. I was galvanized by the thought of her achieving the Continuously Orgasmic State, and wasn’t going to let anything stop me from taking her into that.

After a few more minutes of fucking her with everything I had, she started moan and scream at a constant, near orgasmic-level of sexual pleasure. As she was continuously cumming on my cock I kept thrusting deep inside her pussy. She was dripping all over my balls, and had a huge wet spot underneath herself on the bed. She had reached the Continuously Orgasmic State.

She had ejaculated for the first time in her life.

This was it – and I gave her everything I had for around 20 minutes. I totally lost myself in the passion of the moment – totally forgetting all technique and tactics, and becoming a pure, raw sexual animal. She did the same for me as she came over and over and took my cock deep inside her.

Finally, I was at the edge of my physical endurance. “I’m going to cum inside you,” I told her. I put my legs together, and thrust into her deeply using the muscles of my core to accelerate my orgasm. As the sexual pleasure built up to a fever pitch, I roared like a beast as I exploded deep inside her.

She lay there afterwards as my cum is dripping outside of her wet throbbing pussy – staring glassy eyed at the ceiling in well-fucked satisfaction.

Aftermath

Her legs were spasming afterwards and she couldn’t walk. Exhausted, she quickly fell asleep.

My core muscles were incredibly tired, and I was intensely dehydrated from the marathon session. I cuddled with her until she went to sleep, then quickly grabbed a drink. After this, I soon drifted off myself.

The next morning I woke up, and was like, what the fuck? My back and core were intensely sore, and it was difficult to move. She woke up, and felt the same. But we laid there, looking at each other thinking…it was completely worth it.

We spent the better part kissing and holding each other – and recovering. I left that afternoon with a memory of one of the most intense sexual experiences of my life.

This report is a good model to follow for anyone who is looking to really take their sex life to the next level by putting their girlfriend or wife in the Continuously Orgasmic State. There is a LOT that goes into it – both outside the bedroom and inside it – but once you do it, I guarantee you that you’ll think it was 100% worth it.

Pg 64





Again, the Keys to Pleasure:

 Being the guy she fantasized about before sex began – getting her wanting to have sex with me hours in advance of it actually happening.

 Escalation of more and more intense sex throughout the two previous months of the relationship

 Giving her an orgasm through oral sex before intercourse started to get a “head start” on the Continuously Orgasmic State.

 Shapeshifting – giving her many different types of psychological stimulation

 Having enough sexual stamina to give her constant stimulation when she reached the Continuously Orgasmic State.

Sex Report #3 : Make HER Beg You for Sex by using Passive Dominance Wed, 12/03/2008 - 01:07

This is Michael, the author of SeduceHer Kissing Secrets eBook. I'm glad to be part of the Sex God Method team. Dan's information has really help me take my sexual knowledge to a completely different level.

So below I want to reveal to you my personal sex technique that I came up with after learning about Sex God Method.

It all comes down to sexual framing and I will show you how to make your women beg you for sex. Us men can finally take the keys to sex back from women and let her feel what it's like to be begging for sex all the time. So check this sex report and post me a comment to let me know your thoughts or questions.

I was heading out of town for a business tip for a few days and decided to have a little bit of sexual fun waiting for me when I get back.

I told my girlfriend at the time that she had to behave and not have any type of sexual pleasure until I get back.

That means she can't even masturbate or touch herself. I promise to not do it either to make things fair.

(My specialty is having sex with women in a very quick period of time. And the way I do that is by bringing out the sexual side of her out very quickly. I'll show you guys how to do this later.) I even made sure she didn't cheat by hiding her vibrator.

And to add even more spice to the equation, I made things more interesting by having phone sex with her every night until it was time for me to come back home.

For 3 days straight we had phone sex with each other but I didn't allow her to touch herself (dominance). It was getting so hot neither of us could take it anymore. It was hard for the both of us. She even admitted to cheating by trying to find her vibrator. She search for hours around the house but couldn't find it. I told her I hid it from her to keep her honest. Let's just say she wasn't too happy about that! :D

But I told her to hang on and promised her some amazing mind blowing sex when I get back.

During the phone sex, I made a big point to make sure that she puts her hands behind her head and keep her clothes on to ensure that she doesn't touch herself. Not sure if she didn't cheat but I can sure say it did add a huge psychological effect of me being the one in control (dominance) of her sexual pleasure.

On the day I was supposed to be home, I texted her all day with text messages such as

"I am so hard for you right now"

Pg 65

or

"When I see you, I am going to fuck your brains out"

I kept that sexual tension on all day.

Usually women hold the keys to sex and men hold the keys to relationships.

But because of all this sexual tension I created while I was gone, the tables have changed.

Knowing that I have created more than enough sexual tension and sexual anticipation. I completely took her sexual powers from her by taking her keys to sex.

And she absolutely love it! Talking about having Jedi Mind-Fucking powers. So after building all of this anticipation, I will finally get to enjoy the fruits of my labour.

Here's what happened next.

I asked her to pick me up from the airport.

When she saw me, she jumped on me and immediately attacked my face with kisses.

I gave her a really deep passionate "I missed you" kiss, but made sure to contain myself and pull away. I was rock hard myself even before seeing her.

She started to rub her crotch on my hard cock, but I told her that she has to wait and be a good girl. She's already in trouble with me for cheating by trying to find her vibrator.

So for punishment, she's going to have to be a good girl and she cannot touch me without my permission. But only I can touch her...

Usually when the sexual tension is this high, we'd probably find some place to have sex, whether it be in the car or go into the restroom or rent a hotel room.

But I wanted to take it another step further and make it known that I am in control and have the keys to her sexual pleasure and all she could do is be a good girl and obey my orders in order to have any sexual pleasure from me. And only when she is a good girl and do what I wish is when I will please her deprived sexual appetite.

You can imagine how sexually frustrated she felt. Now she finally gets to taste of what blue balls feels like for men.

During the whole drive, I was kissing her, teasing her and talking dirty to her. But every time she would try to respond or touch me, I would put her in check,

"Ah, Ah, Ah. NO! You naughty little girl."

And then tell her,

"Only I can touch or you're not getting any at all."

Pg 66

Sure enough she would always be a good little girl and contain herself. Every once in a while the pleasure would become unbearable for her that she test her boundaries and break the rules by trying to touch me or grab my hand and shove it inside of her already soaking wet pussy. Then I establish more DOMINANCE by keeping her in check.

This step is important because if you don't check her when she is out of line, whether it be in relationships and sex, she will not only lose respect for you in the long run, but it will ruin the dominance aspect of sex.

Be her man NOT her butler. Always hold back and don't always give her what she wants. Instead, make her work for it. I actually like to make her work HARD for it.

All the way home I had my hands up her skirt and feeling how soaking wet she was getting.

But one thing I wasn't doing was fingering inside her or any type of actual penetration.

I teased her and lightly rubbed her pussy outside of her underwear slowly up and down, left and right and would make small circles. I may put a finger or two close to her opening and get close to sticking it inside of her, but then I would pull back to build up more anticipation and sexual tension.

It drove her crazy.

I would escalate by pulling her in close and kissing her neck and ears and whispering stuff like

"Oh baby, your pussy is soooooo wet."

and

"You have been thinking about fucking me all day haven't you".

Then I would pull away and say something really casual like oh wow, look at all the traffic.

This stuff would just drive her completely mad.

After doing this several times, it got to a point where it was unbearable to me! But I knew I had to control myself. I had to be a man and show strength and constraint. And doing so will only hit the passive dominance arousal in her even more.

But this is where the men separates the boys. I am being dominant without being forceful. I set the frame where I had full and absolutely total control over her sexual pleasure and she was at my mercy if she wanted any pleasure from me.

The moment we pulled up to my apartment, I pulled her in and made out with her hard and passionately then started to rip her shirt off while still in the car.

When she thinks "it's on", I would pull away and casually say, hey babe, help me with the luggage... I would try to either slow her down and tease her a bit more to amp up the sexual tension.

This whole process of hot-cold, hot-cold is a technique that Neuro Linguistic Programing uses called Fractionation.

Pg 67

Whenever you put someone in a trace and you take then out by pulling away and going back in, it will make them fall into a deeper trance.

In this particular case, by me being hot-cold then hotter-cold to her, it makes her fall deeper and deeper in sexual ecstasy.

I am hitting a lot of VARIETY in the DEVI system and it really helps amplifies how horny she is.

After we go inside, I take the luggage from her hands, and throw it on the ground. Then I grab her and pull her to the couch, turn her around, tear off her panties, bent her over and fucked her brains out.

At this point she was already soaking wet. She came within seconds of me being inside her. We were both throbbing so hard. I could feel how tender her wet pussy was from all of that sexual anticipation.

I kept ramming my hard cock and going deeper and deeper inside her; stimulating her psychological by doing more dirty talk.

"You like that naughty little girl?"

"Your pussy is soooo wet."

"You have been thinking about fucking hard all day haven't you?"

She came again... Then again... Then again. Each time she came I would escalate the dirty talk by telling her stuff like,

"You naughty slut, is this what you wanted?"

"Is this how you wanted to be fucked?"

"Is what you wanted me to do to you?"

Within the first 10 minutes, she came over 4 times.

And because I had so much tension and sexual build up inside me I could hold it much longer.

So I started to pound her faster and harder.

Each time, I ram my hard cock deeper and deeper inside her.

And each and every time, she would scream and moan in painstaking agony of the intense sexual pleasure.

Every time she comes, her orgasm becomes more and more intense. Her body would start to shake uncontrollably.

The feeling was amazing.

Then I started feeling myself getting ready to come from deep inside of me.

I pounded her more and more, harder and harder every time. The sofa started sliding and the room started to move.

Pg 68





I used one hand to grab her by her shoulder and pull her into me even harder. The other hand I grab a handful of hair and pulled her head back towards me every time I pounded.

She screamed, "I AM GOING TO CUM"

It would be her 7th time.

Right as she said that I completely lost control... I let go of myself and felt the warm fluids from deep inside my hard raging cock gushing inside of her.

We both came together. We came so hard that we both collapsed and passed out.

Being in pure bliss and ecstasy, I can feel my hard cock still throbbing inside her soaking wet pussy. It wanted more and I was about to give it to her again as soon as we woke up...

It was probably one of the best sexual experiences in my life!

By holding the keys to sex and making sex with me the highest value to her, it made sex a reward for her. And I can get sex whenever I wanted because of this.

I also applied a technique called Passive Dominance which I have done many times before but only recently discovered. You saw it being demonstrated in this Sex Report and I will explain it a little more on a separate post.

Some of the technique in this report is a prime example of how you can use passive DOMINANCE to drive a women wild. Not all dominance has to be strong, loud or forceful. If you have authority and control of her and she submits to that, you have establish dominance. Set the rules and hold her to it. Because you are the one who created it, you are the dominant one and she has no choice but to submit.

Also, notice how I used VARIETY by using sexual fractionation to really amp up her sexual anticipation and sexual tension. And by combining it with passive DOMINANCE, you can completely skip foreplay and go directly to sex.

You also get to see the importance of the psychological aspect of sex. By saving each other for a few days and by not pleasuring ourselves it created the sexual need and void. And at the same time amplifying that sexual void by stimulating the psychological aspect of sex, it made the sex 10 times better. She was able to achieve the Continuous Orgasmic State. She even came within a few minutes of me being inside of her.

And by having so much sexual tension and anticipation, you can't help but to naturally have IMMERSION.

My Summary Notes

Track 4

o

Dirty talk is one of the most powerful ways to show dominance and turn her on

 An easy way to get into dirty talk

 “baby it feels so good to be inside of you”

Pg 69





 Then step up to the Possession theme, which is the most powerful dirty talk technique.

Communicate to her that she belongs to you

 “baby you belong to me”

 “baby your pussy belongs to me”

 “you’re all mine”

 Possession type dirty talk also makes what you’re saying to her more acceptable to her

o

i.e. “you’re a dirty slut” vs. “you’re my dirty slut” or “you’re my dirty little whore”

 Say it with commitment and don’t look for a reaction from her

 All women respond to dirty talk. However when doing it for the first time with your girl (or if she is sexually inexperienced), she might be a little confused but don’t mistake it for her being upset. This is a critical moment, don’t apologise, don’t react. Keep doing it, make it seem like a normal thing that you do all the time, then she’ll let her arousal come to the fore. Her non-reaction doesn’t mean she doesn’t like it, she just needs a little guidance & time to really get into it

Interviews – SGMMonth1

Interview of Johnny Wolf. My summary notes

 Dominance was the most lacking factor for Johnny. He used to think grabbing a girls hair should be gentle like touching flowers. He didn’t realise how much girls want you to dominate them sexually. In bed they want to be thrown around like a ragdoll. The correct way to grab her hair is to grip close to the roots so she isn’t hurt. However being verbally dominant is 95% of Dominance.

o

Let her know she’s your “filthy little bitch/dirty little slut” in bed, but after sex treat her like a princess. These are not mutually exclusive concepts. It’s not a bad thing to call a girl a slut. Girls love being your slut in bed.

o

This was also the biggest hurdle for Daniel to overcome, to be good in bed. He was so restricted by his own logic. You can’t call a girl a slut and also say you love her at the same time, because they are contradictory.

o

However he eventually realised that girls don’t care if you make sense in bed. They only care if you’re turning them on. After that, he was able to combine Emotion & Dominance in bed and started doing more Dominance in relationships.

o

Johnny started off practising being more verbally Dominant by testing her and wrapping it with Emotion. He’d say to his girl, “baby I like you so much, you’re so sexy, you’re such a sweet girl, now suck my dick like a little slut.”

o

Johnny also realised that calling her ‘your little slut’ rather than ‘a little slut’ made her feel a lot better.

o

Johnny also learnt that girls who are very socially dominant or having high-powered careers i.e.

the alpha females are the ones that want to be dominated the most. Their ultimate fantasy is to meet a guy that is even more confident and dominant than they are. They will test you on it, don’t be apprehensive about her being offended by your sexual dominance. She’ll break down, go down on her knees and say “ok I’m your dirty little slut.” Don’t make the mistake of meeting a super-dominant girl and thinking that Dominance won’t work on her. They are the ones who it works best on!

o

Johnny had a girlfriend once that was very socially dominant. However in bed she loved Johnny taking control of her. She really blow open Johnny’s perception of the limit to Dominating a girl in bed.

 Girls want that fantasy in bed that they’re being taken, being dominated and controlled.

They get more and more into it by saying stop even though they don’t want to and are really being turned on.

Pg 70





o

Throw logic out of the window. Logic has nothing to do with sex. Sex is 100% emotion based.

You can never logically talk a girl into bed.

o

It took a while for Daniel to stop feeling guilty about ‘abusing’ the girl by dominating her in bed.

You’re actually denying a girl pleasure by not giving her the Dominance she craves.

 Dominance

o

If you’re not familiar with being dominant in bed, start off small then move up to more advanced stuff

o

Dirty talk, whilst having sex say to her, “babe I love being inside of you” then graduate on to,

“you know what baby, you’re going to bend over like a little fucking whore tonight and give it to me”

DIRTY TALK TIPS: WHAT SHE WANTS - JESS SUMMERS

Chapter 1 – Why you should learn how to talk dirty

1. Why should you bother with dirty talk?

You've heard it in movies and TV... and you've definitely seen it in action in porn... but how do you know where to begin when you want to start spicing things up a little by engaging in erotic banter with your partner?

For a lot of guys it seems like a bit of a minefield. Will it make her laugh? Will it come across as sleazy? How do I know what to say? How do I not feel like a dickhead when I'm saying this stuff?

And for that matter, is it even something you should bother considering? I mean, it seems to work for those guys on the tv, but are real life girls really turned on by how you talk to them while you're in the throes?

Well the answer to that is most certainly...

YES! YES WE ARE! OH MY GOD, YES!

Think about it for a minute.

You LOVE it when she tells you what a great cock you have (who doesn't want to hear that?), and when she says she loves the way you feel next to her.

Of course she wants to hear something similar in return.

Has a girl ever told you how much she can't wait to feel the bulge in your trousers? Or your mouth on hers?

How great is it to be told that someone is lusting after you?

Everyone enjoys praise and appreciation, and sex is no different. Don't think for a second that your girl would rather hear nothing at all than listen to you telling her how she's turning you on in that hot lingerie of hers.

You can take this as absolute fact. Women want and enjoy dirty talk every bit as much as you do.

But if you're still not sure, consider for a moment the flip side.

Pg 71





What is some of the worst sex you've had? Every single person we polled when we were bringing together the material for this book gave a similar answer to this question. Guess what it was… I'll give you an example from one respondent:

" Oh sure, I've had my share of bad sex over the years. And it's almost always when the other person refuses to make any noise! I mean, are they even enjoying what I'm doing? Should I just stop? I have no idea, because I'm getting no feedback whatsoever. That kind of sex... it's just terrible."

I'm sure you're sitting there nodding. We've all been there. You're going down on a girl... you could be there for AGES... but you're getting no response. Nothing. Nada. Not a moan, no encouragement, no sign of pleasure at all. Gah!

Silence in the bedroom is one of the biggest turn offs for us all.

So, if noise is so important to our experience, imagine what response you'll get when you're able to take it a step further and wow her with your verbal skills in the bedroom.

And that is why you will positively shine in her eyes if you pay attention to all the fantastic tips and tricks you'll learn here... and bring some much appreciated verbal communication to the bedroom in the form of dirty talk!

2. Dirty talk is important for casual encounters AND relationships The first thing to note about talking dirty is that it's a skill you can take with you into each and every encounter you have... whether it's just casual play, or with your long-term girlfriend or partner.

Think of dirty talk as being just like any of the other abilities you've honed over the years. Remember when you first had sex, and how inexperienced you were? It makes you shudder a little when you consider how much more you know now (and how bad you must have been then)!

You need to think of dirty talk the same way... as a skill you can add to your repertoire just like those fingering moves you've developed over the years, or your awesome kissing technique.

And that means, whoever you are, and whatever your current situation, learning how to talk dirty is always going to benefit you and your partner.

3. But I'm a guy... how can I possibly know what women want to hear?

You might think there are vast differences in how men and women approach sex, but the chasm isn't as wide as you might think. Seriously!

Sure, everyone is a little different... but not just because of gender. There are a million tiny variables that make up who we are and what turns us on. Preferences are what makes us individual, and your partner's likes are probably part of what brought the two of you together in the first place!

The fact that our sexual differences aren't really that heavily rooted in gender is fantastic news for you, because it means you don't have to think in an entirely new way just because you're talking to a girl!

Ok, it's true that some women can tend towards a more emotional involvement when it comes to sex, but this shouldn't affect how you talk to them. After all, dirty talk isn't about you wooing a delicate maiden, or analyzing your deepest emotions. And it isn't about promising that you'll be together forever.

What dirty talk is for, when it comes down to it, is setting the mood for sex.

Pg 72





Yup, there's no mincing words on that one. When you and your girl talk dirty to one another it is for the sole purpose of building anticipation, sexual tension, or heightening your encounters. And when it comes to enjoying sex... women and men both want the same awesome experiences.

So there you have it. Yes, you'll have to remember that everyone is different when it comes to dirty talk, so you'll need to be at least a bit flexible. But you're now also safe in the knowledge that your girl isn't from another planet... and you won't have to crack some secret code to get her all worked up.

In fact, the more you read on, the more you're going to realize just how easy it is to add some much appreciated spice to your playtime. Girls aren’t all that complicated when you know what buttons to push… and before you think you couldn’t possibly know what those buttons are, we’re going to show them to you right here!

4. What you'll learn

Before we delve any further into how you can start adding dirty talk to your bedroom antics, I have to make one thing clear.

Only you know what your girl really likes and dislikes and no two women are exactly the same. You're therefore going to have to take your cues from her at all times. You need to keep this mantra in mind from now on. We will give you an amazing, proven guide to talking dirty right here, but you're still in charge of taking this information and experimenting with it.

Although this is true, once you learn the collection of phrases, words and ideas we've collected for you in this book, you'll already have all the tools you'll need to find out what works best for your girl. That puts you ahead of most of the other guys she's ever encountered before, and she's definitely going to appreciate and recognize the difference!

When it comes right down to it, even if you're not getting the responses you might like from your dirty talk, there are other ways you can make sure she's turned on and ready to play (which we'll outline for you later in this book). It's just a matter or trying and testing until you find the right combination for the two of you. And just imagine what fun you'll have doing that!

The thing to remember is that it's all about heightening yours and your partner's experience (and having fun!), so you can't go wrong if you take this attitude with you into the bedroom.

To make sure you're armed with all the information and inspiration you need, in the following chapters we'll show you:

 How to become comfortable talking dirty... it's not uncommon to feel self conscious at first, but you'll learn how to get into the swing of things quickly and at a pace that works well for you and your girl.

 How to tone it up or down, depending on what responses you're getting.

 What NOT to say when you're talking dirty.

 How you can read her body language to gauge her responses, even if she's not telling you outright.

 Compliments she's always going to want to hear.

 How to tackle dirty talk during oral sex... you do want her to come back, don't you?

 Using dirty talk in text messages, on the phone, and over the Internet to keep your girl wanting more, even if you're not there in person.

Chapter 2 – Becoming comfortable talking dirty

Knowing is different from doing, right?

You know that dirty talk, done right, is going to turn your girl on and improve your encounters together. But that doesn't mean you feel comfortable doing it. Hell, you've probably even given it a go once or twice, but hearing yourself say that stuff just didn't sound right somehow.

Fortunately, successfully talking dirty, like most things in life, is easy once it's broken down for you.

Knowledge is power, people! As soon as you know what you're doing, the rest just falls into place.

Think of it like having to give a speech in public. There are some people who can just get up in front of a crowd and talk . on the spot . about anything, and be awesome at it. But those people are far and few between.

Most of us are pretty uncomfortable with the idea, especially if you suddenly have to speak unprepared about something you're not too sure about. But if you're asked to talk about a subject you're an expert in, then it isn't really so bad, is it? At least you won’t be stuck for material, and with practice, it just becomes normal.

The same is true for talking dirty. Some people have the knack... don't ask me how, but they just inherently know what to say and it seems to work. The rest of us have to rely on becoming familiar enough with the subject so that it starts to feel normal the more we talk about it.

And that's what we're going to explore right here! But first, let's start by discussing exactly what dirty talk is...

1. What is dirty talk?

Dirty talk is simply any comment you make before or during sex that's designed to arouse your partner.

When you tell her she looks pretty in that new dress of hers... that's a lovely compliment. But if you say, "Baby, you look so hot in that dress that I can't wait to rip it from your body when we get home tonight", that's dirty talk.

The difference is just that one is a wonderful way to make your girl feel good, and the other not only makes her feel good, it makes her feel sexy, and conveys to her just how much you want her.

You can talk dirty to your girl at any time. It doesn't just have to be while you're having sex, or in the direct lead up to it. You can (and should!) randomly spice up her day with wonderfully graphic descriptions of how you're going to take her the second she walks through the door that evening. Or how she's been in your thoughts since you left for work that morning, inspiring all sorts of wonderful daytime fantasies.

And dirty talk isn't limited to actual conversations either. You have email, texting, phone calls, webcamming, instant messaging... you name it! You could be having the busiest day at work EVER, and still have time to tap out a quick text message saying how you've missed her luscious lips all day.

Which leads me to another point. What you say doesn't even have to be true! OK, I know that sounds a little callous, but you're trying to achieve heightened passion here, so it's fine to tell her you're fantasizing about being under her desk even if you're up to your eyeballs in meetings all morning.

Of course, then there's the dirty talk that's left specifically for the bedroom... when you're in the throes and you want to make the moment even sexier. This is the sort of talk most guys have trouble with, because there's no barrier between you and your girl that you can use for confidence. But you can overcome your apprehensions with a few simple suggestions...

Pg 74





2. Don’t be shy

a. Say it like you mean it!

Women say it time and again... a confident man can get away with just about anything.

You've also seen it in action plenty of times before. You know, when that average-looking guy always seems to have a hot girl hanging off his arm. How is a guy like that scoring the hotties? It's almost certainly because he's confident enough to go after her.

And that's what you've got to remember when it comes to talking dirty. If you feel silly, don't let it show. If you're not sure, hide your insecurity and she'll never be the wiser.

If you say it with confidence it WILL sound fantastically sexy. It's a pretty simple concept, but it certainly works. Say it like you mean it!

Here's a way you can test this out when you're chatting with friends. Make up a fictional answer to some question, state it with confidence like it's a fact, and your mates probably won't even think to question you.

Confidence is key.

b. Practice makes perfect

One of the hardest things to get used to when you first start dirty talking is simply how it sounds to you when it comes out of your mouth. Hearing the words out loud, they can sort of echo in your head and can seem forced.

I'm actually going to quickly take a moment to tell you that, even though it might sound weird to you, it DOES

NOT sound that way to your girl.

So, if it's a matter of you getting used to the way it sounds, why not pick a few dirty phrases and just practice saying them out loud when you're on your own?

It might not sound very spontaneous, but if it helps you get used to hearing them spoken out loud, then it's worth it!

c. She's on your side

The most important thing to remember when you're trying to overcome your shyness is that she's your girl... she won't make you feel foolish!

And the same is true even for casual encounters. You've already gotten as far as the bedroom, your partner isn't looking for ways to ridicule you. She's looking for more ways to make a connection with you. Dirty talk is going to provide her with added interaction that will make her feel special, connected, sexy, and amped! She's most certainly going to appreciate it, not shun it.

Just have that in the back of your mind when you start talking dirty to her and it will soon boost your confidence and help you overcome your shyness.

3. Heat things up slowly

You know by now that silence during sex is one of the biggest turn offs for women. This is extremely important!

SILENCE IS NOT SEXY!

Pg 75

If she has to ask you if you've cum yet, then there is something very wrong going on. If she's not sure you're enjoying your blowjob, then there's very little chance she's going to want to do it again, or put in very much effort if she does. Why would she? There's no incentive if you're not rewarding her with even the merest moan.

So, very simply and easily... start things off by making some noise.

Moans, groans, gasps and grunts all convey to your girl that you're paying attention to what she's doing and you're loving every second of it.

Remember how you'd jump through hoops to get a gold star from your teacher when you were young? I mean, it was a sticker... why did you even care? I'll tell you why. You cared because it represented appreciation and praise, and most of us will go out of our way to feel appreciated. Your moans convey praise for your girl's efforts, and they'll not only make her feel sexier, you'll also benefit as she puts in more effort to receive more praise! It's absolutely a win-win situation.

Bringing noise into the bedroom is the perfect starting off point for dirty talk. It will be an especially effective means of gradually introducing dirty talk into your play if you've never dabbled before. Your girl will become used to you being more vocal, so when you start talking to her during sex it won't come as much of a shock.

And we've got some other suggestions for helping you heat things up slowly...

a. Add some background noise

If you've got music on in the background . even if it's just the radio . your own voice won't echo around the room as much when you talk out loud. It's like the difference between singing a solo unaccompanied, and singing alone with a tune on your iPod. You always sing louder and with more confidence when you've got backing. So turn the music up and use it to your advantage. Just make sure that anything you say can be heard over the din.

b. Whisper in her ear

It can be easier to start off by whispering than to boldly state your desires out loud, and this isn't a bad thing. It's particularly fun if you're locked in a close embrace and she's clinging to your shoulders... take advantage of your proximity to murmur into her ear how wonderful she feels. It will get you both used to the talk a little more gradually, and the sensation of your hot breath in her ear will almost certainly drive her wild. Especially if you add a little nibble or two!

c. Use the tools at your fingertips

Text messaging or emailing is the perfect way to prime your girl up for verbal dirty talk. You're not right in front of her when you write your messages, so you can be as bold as you like. Then later, when you play out the scenarios you've described in your texts, all you need to do is remind her out loud that this is what you said you'd do. It takes the pressure off you to be overly vocal, while at the same time getting her excited about playing with you. You can do the same with email, or even little notes that you've left for her in her purse or around the house.

The ways you can introduce dirty talk into your relationship... or even getting used to it yourself... are limited only by your resourcefulness. But the sooner you start, the sooner you're going to see the positive influence it has on your sex life and you're girl's enjoyment!

So what's next on the agenda? There's no cookie cutter formula for what to say to your girl, but we're going to help you figure out what sort of talk your partner is going to enjoy most in the following chapters...

Pg 76





Chapter 3 – Different Girls Like Different Dirty Talk

You'll realize by now that, when it comes to talking dirty, there's no "one size fits all" way of getting your girl's heart racing.

Think of it like this... if you told the same joke to everyone you met, you wouldn't expect every single person to find it hilarious. A crude joke wouldn't go down well with a conservative audience. And an in-joke only means something to the people who were there when it was first made. You need to know your audience so you can tell the joke to the right people if you want to make sure it will be a hit!

But of course, a good comedian wouldn't be satisfied with waiting for the right audience to come along. He'd develop a repertoire of jokes for different moods and people. Then, once he had identified his audience, he could tell the right kind of joke for maximum laughs every time.

And there you have it. The exact same principles apply to talking dirty. Everyone's got different tastes, moods, and preferences, so you need to keep that in mind when you start to talk dirty to your girl.

But that doesn't need to panic you. Just make sure you've got a stock of different words and phrases to draw from when you talk dirty, so you can adapt to her preferences or mood. The more prepared you are, the easier this will be!

So, continue on to learn how you can read your girl's mood, get a feel for what she likes, and make sure you're pitching your talk at the right level right from the start...

1. Some girls like it sweet... and others prefer it dirtier. How will you know the difference?

There's no doubt that some people (girls AND guys) prefer their dirty talk to remain a little less explicit. At the same time, others love it down and dirty... the nastier the better!

Most of us fall somewhere in the middle, and may even move from one to the other depending on our mood or how accustomed we've become to dirty talk in the past. And that's just fine, because you can still say everything you want, no matter how she likes it... you just need to make sure it's at a tone she's comfortable with.

But you're not a mind reader, so how do you know where to begin? Where does your girl fit into this? And how do you know what to say when you want to heat up a casual encounter?

a. Test the waters and start off slow

The first thing to remember is that you can always work up to being more explicit... but it's harder to take back what has already been said if it didn't go over very well.

So start slow unless you know for a fact that your girl likes it nasty (you'll probably already have heard her speaking to you that way, so you'll know she thinks it's hot)!

What does it mean to start slow? Check out the comparison at the end of this chapter to see how you can say the same thing a few different ways to suit what turns her on.

b. Embrace the written word

Begin by texting or emailing her with your plans for what you want to do to her the next time you meet.

Why? Because writing something down is a LOT easier than saying it out loud. You'll be able to say what you want without being embarrassed, and she won't be as shy when she responds.

Pg 77





It's the perfect way to test the waters and see what she thinks. And of course it's plenty of fun along the way.

c. Read the signs

But that's not where it ends, because the most important part comes next... Pay close attention to how she responds!

If she's upping the level of nastiness, then that's a strong clue she likes it a bit wilder. If you're getting a more conservative reply, then take note... this is what she is more comfortable with (for now)!

It’s important to factor in that women can be less direct with what they like and don't like in bed. She's not always going to just come out and say, "I don't like that," or "I love it when you talk dirty." But take heart that there will always be clues. You just need to make sure you're looking for them!

So here it is again... pay close attention to how she responds to your dirty talk!!

Especially if this is new ground for the both of you.

If she sends you hot reply messages, if she moans loader, or even smiles, nods or performs what you ask of her... these are good signs.

If you're getting quizzical looks, if she seems even a little reluctant, is changing the topic, or just appears generally unenthusiastic... then you're not on the right track. Try toning it down a little or asking her if she enjoys how you're talking.

DO NOT push her farther than she seems to enjoy or your fun activity will become a chore for you and distasteful for her.

d. Women are complex!

You already know that women sometimes operate on a series of signals you're supposed to be able to decode as if by magic. Most of the time you can just shrug it off if you're clueless, but this is one of those times that reading the wrong signal can throw your confidence way off kilter.

A bad response to your first attempts at dirty talk can prevent you from trying again, but bear in mind that it may be just that you’re reading the situation incorrectly.

For example, just because she doesn't talk dirty back to you when you're together doesn't mean she hates what you're doing. She may just not have the confidence yet to do the same back. Or the timing might not be right for her.

Don't give up! Remember that women are wonderful, mysterious beings and try it again on another occasion.

Tone it down or up. Go back to texts and see what responses you get. Or, if you're just not getting clues you need, come out and ask your girl if she likes it... again, doing so in an email or text can be easier if you've got an attack of shyness.

2. Mix it up a little

When you have sex, you don't do exactly the same thing each time (hopefully!). Sometimes you want it hard and fast, sometimes sweet and slow... it depends on your mood, your girl's mood, what kind of a day you've had, and even how long it's been since you last had sex! There are a hundred little variables.

Talking dirty is no different.

Pg 78





You just have to put it out there and read the signals she responds with, but as you get more comfortable with talking dirty, you'll be able to keep her guessing by mixing it up or gradually introducing more flavour to your talk.

3. A comparison so you can tone it up or down

It's always easier to understand something after you've seen examples, so here's a comparison of some fantastic dirty talk themes and ways you can say them, depending on what your girl likes to hear.

Of course, you should mix and match what you say (and how), depending on how comfortable you have become talking dirty and who you're talking to, but this will be an excellent starting off point.

Just a note... if you think some of these terms don't seem like what you'd say... THAT'S THE POINT! They're what girls want to hear, not what you think they want to hear. That would be something completely different.

But this will get you thinking along the right lines.

Chapter 4 – Making Your Dirty Talk Even Dirtier

We've spoken already about pitching your dirty talk at a level you and your girl are comfortable with. Well, to do that effectively, you need to think of it as being more than just a few muttered phrases thrown out here and there.

To really get her in the mood (and keep her there), you need to understand that dirty talk also extends into the names you call your girl, and your ability to distinguish what's sexy from what's just plain graphic (something YOU might enjoy, but she may not).

Remember the example earlier about how it's easier to make a speech in public if you are given a topic you're familiar with? That's our goal here... to bring you all the information you need so you're totally familiar with all aspects of talking dirty. That way you'll be able to combine what you've learned to get it right every time.

Pg 82





So this chapter is all about making sure you've considered all aspects of dirty talk. You’ll then be as prepared as possible to drive your girl wild!

Using the right names for her

There's a subset of talking dirty devoted entirely to the names you call your girl.

Let's talk first off about the cute nicknames you and your girl have for each other... and they can be anything, can't they? They come from shared experiences you have, are particular to the two of you, and are added to and altered all the time. And while these names are utterly adorable, don't take them into the bedroom with you!

Sweet nicknames are for cuddling and reclining on the sofa with your limbs interlocked . they are NOT for arousing your girl or getting her in the mood for hot sex . so leave the pet names for holding hands on the beach, and learn something sexier for your dirty talk.

So, where to begin?

The names we call each other can be a bit of a bone of contention, so it's tricky ground if you're not paying attention to the reactions you get.

Every girl is going to be a little different... some hate being called names that might suggest they're promiscuous (slut, whore, etc), while other girls love how dirty that is and positively revel in being called someone's "sweet tramp".

Like everything else, you need to keep an eye on what names get the best responses. Try them out in text messages, emails or on msn first. If your girl really likes a particular name, she may even start calling herself that.

If you're looking for names for casual encounters, then just out and out ask your partner what she likes and dislikes. She'll have some names that are off limits, and it's better you know that before you meet up.

To inspire you, we've pulled together a list on 50 dirty talk names you can draw inspiration from. Some are a lot more explicit than others, but every girls is different, so we've included a good range.

(her actual

name)

deviant

ho

personal

porn

star

super freak

babe

dirty girl

horny baby

pretty lady

sweet slut

baby

filthy whore

hot mama

sex goddess

talented little

cocksucker

baby girl

freak

hot stuff

sex kitten

temptress

bad girl

freaky girl

hottie

sexy

tramp

bitch

fuck bunny

minx

sexy beast

vixen

cock slut

fuck doll

mistress

sexy lady

wench

cum slut

good girl

nasty girl

siren

whore

cunt

gorgeous

naughty girl

slapper

super freak

cutie

harpie

nimpho

slave

sweet slut

You'll notice from the list that some of the names are combinations, and of course you can do that with other words than just these. In fact, adding "sweet", "lovely", "pretty", "delicious", "talented", "wonderful", "clever", etc to a much harder term (like "slut") immediately makes it a lot more playful and endearing.

Pg 83





As a demonstration... "Come here my pretty little slut" sounds a LOT more intimate and playful than "Come here slut."

The point of any dirty talk and name calling is to make your girl feel sexy and get her in the mood for fun, so remember that when you're searching for terms you can use in the bedroom (or in messages, texts, emails, msns, etc). The more desired she feels, the better your fun is likely to be!

So next, let's have a look at the tone you use when you talk dirty, as this can be tricky ground.

How to tell dirty from just plain rude

When you were reading through the examples in the last chapter, you may have looked at the "nasty" column and thought, "Yeah, that's nowhere near as nasty as I could be." Or even as nasty as you've heard before. And you're right! They are explicit examples of talking dirty, but they're not as nasty as they could be.

Let me give you an example. We asked a guy friend his opinion on some of the entries we had listed. His response was that the more explicit column wasn't really that nasty. "Oh yeah," we responded, "What do you mean?"

He told me, "Well, it's not as hardcore as saying something like: 'I want to lick my cum off you as it oozes out of your asshole.'"

Of course he was right. That’s a lot more specifically explicit. And it brought up a really important point that some guys never properly consider... girls DO want dirty talk, but they DON'T necessarily want freaky porn talk.

This might be the sort of thing guys want to say, have heard people say in films, or even enjoy hearing themselves, but in general, it is not what your girl wants to hear.

This is a really vital distinction! It just isn't as sexy for girls to hear that kind of talk.

Your dirty talk is for her, so think about what she might like to hear and stay away from anything that seems excessively nasty. The majority of women aren't looking to hear you talk about your cum oozing from anywhere.

Or it splattering their face, etc. (Although of course there are always exceptions to the rule.) A good rule of thumb here is to think about the focus of what you're saying.

If the focus is your girl (how hot she is, how hard she makes you, how much you love her tits, how much you can't wait to be licking her), then she's going to be able to relate to what you're saying. She can identify that you're feeling this way specifically because of her, which makes her feel special, wanted and desired.

If the focus of your talk is you (where you're going to cum, how you're going to enjoy tearing her apart, how you can't wait to unload into her), then it's not going to be as easy for her to relate to, and is therefore less likely to make her feel special. After all, you could be doing those things to any girl, not specifically just her.

Think of it like this... if she whispered in your ear, "I love cock", would that be as hot as if she whispered, "I love your cock"? Of course you'd prefer to hear about your own cock and how it makes her happy!

Make her the focus of your talk and you're bound to get a great reaction.

Pg 84





Again, as with everything, there are exceptions to the rule. If this sort of talk really does it for you, then test the waters and see what responses you get. Perhaps your girl thinks the same way!

How you can introduce even dirtier talk

We’ve reinforced the point that your dirty talk is primarily for her, not you, so it's important that she likes how you talk dirty to her.

However! That doesn't mean you can't amp things up... even if you've had lukewarm responses to certain approaches in the past.... and here's how: Roleplay.

Design a scenario for your girl in which it would be more in character to talk nastier (or however it is you've been wanting to talk to her). Then make it as easy as possible for her to play it out with you.

Here's a tip: don't just make it your fantasy scenario! Incorporate something she daydreams about too.

Not sure what she likes? Women can be less forthcoming about what secretly turns them on, so test her for reactions! You can gather information about what your girl likes by throwing offhand remarks into conversations. For example, here's a simple one... "Stop being so smug about getting to leave work early, or I'm going to have to put you over my knee and spank you."

You'll be able to gauge from her reaction to this "joke" about whether or not this is something she might secretly enjoy the sound of. If she responds with something like, "Promises, promises", could very well be a fantasy. If her response is more like, "Don't be stupid", then you're probably on the wrong track.

The more information you can gather about what turns her on, the better... even if you don't play it out exactly like that. In this case, you might not actually spank your girl, but she's given an indication that she would like to be either dominated a little or manhandled. So she may enjoy being "arrested" for indecent exposure in a roleplay scenario.

You get the idea! And all the while, even offhand remarks like the example above are a form of talking dirty :) So once you have a plan, start off by asking her if she'd be into it. Then gradually tell her about your scenario, how you see it working, what suggestions she might have, and how excited it's making you.

You can both lose yourselves in the characters and have fun taking the dirty talk to a different level!

Chapter 5 – How To Interpret Her Signals

Communication is always important with your partner. It seems like it should be simple pretty simple to just talk with your girl, but it isn't always as easy as that.

There are all sorts of personal factors that can make it difficult to be frank about your dirty talk.

You may be shy about asking her what she wants. You may not want to offend your girl by raising the particulars of what she likes and doesn't like about your dirty talk. She might be embarrassed to talk about it, or she may not want to discourage you by saying she hasn't enjoyed something. And in fact, she might not even KNOW what she likes or doesn't like until she hears it!

There are any number of a hundred reasons why it can be tricky! But the important thing to remember is that she isn't going to hold it against you if you don't get it right the first time. Don't let it put you off!! I guarantee she still wants you to talk dirty to her, you just need to make a note of what works... and what doesn't.

Pg 85





So, how the hell can you be sure what's really turning her on if she isn't actually telling you?

Well, women are all about the signals. Murmurs, insinuations, body language, tone, the ABSENCE of saying something, moans, a LACK of moans, hesitation, topic avoidance, cagey answers, changing the subject... you name it, we consider it a signal! And here’s the kicker… to us it’s all very obvious, and we can’t understand why you’re not able to read our subtle signs.

With something like talking dirty, being able to interpret your girl's signals is particularly important. You definitely DON'T want to turn her off by unintentionally offending her when your goal is the exact opposite!

But before you panic, you’ll be glad to know that reading her signals is not really an impossible task... even for someone who has never been able to crack the code before. That's what this chapter all about: how you can read her signs so your dirty talk always turns her on (not off).

And you know what? You don't have to stop with just dirty talk. You'll be able to use your interpreting skills for everything you enjoy in the bedroom to really drive your experiences to the next level :) Make a note of what turns her on and off

As we've mentioned, when it comes to sex and talking dirty, not everyone is comfortable saying out loud what they like and dislike.

Women in particular may not come out and tell you when they want (or don't want) something. Their secret desires may be too dirty for them to want to own up to, for example. Or they're not sure they really want the fantasy to become a reality, so voicing it may be too big a step. Other women simply haven't felt the need to be vocal before, so they're unused to it.

For whatever reason, what this means is that you're going to have to become good at reading the signals, and the first step is always just being aware that you need to look for the signs.

Just remember that at all times that you're looking for her responses to what you say. Your success depends on you being able to identify what she wants and making sure you deliver it. Otherwise you're ultimately the one who loses out if she's not turned on by your talk!

Always, always remember that your dirty talk is for HER, not you.

The fastest way to fail when you're talking dirty is to just say what you want to hear rather than what she does.

WRONG. Also wrong is assuming she likes what you're saying because some other girl enjoyed it, or you heard it in a porn flick.

Each girl is different and will have different preferences.

So, again, pay attention to what responses you're getting from certain phrases, words, levels of explicitness, and names. Here's what you should be looking for...

Verbal signals

Let's start with the easy one...

1. What she tells you she likes

When your girl tells you straight out that she likes or doesn't like something, PAY ATTENTION. This is the simplest and easiest communication you're going to receive, so take this gift and make the most of it!

Pg 86

Not all women will be comfortable being so straight forward from the start, but if your girl is, then ask her!

2. Take your cues from how she's talking to you

This is another easy one for you. Listen to the language your girls uses when she's talking to you and pitch your tone to match hers.

If she's referring to herself as your "dirty girl", then you'll know for certain you can call her that too! And if she can't wait to get her hands on your "cock", you can use the term when you're talking to her.

There are a lot of little clues you can gather, from the words she uses to refer to her boobs, to whether she enjoys a good "shag", "romp", or "fuck". And if you make a note of how she talks in general, then you'll already have a good idea about her preferences.

Of course, you'll always be able to test out amping up the talk if you want, but at the very least you'll know where to begin . and what she's already comfortable with . which is a huge start.

3. Murmurs and moans

Murmurs and moans are slightly more subtle, but women widely use them to express what they like. Listen out for her sounds! A well placed "mmmmmmmm" tells you you're on the right track. While clipped short "hmm"

doesn't bode as well.

Think of an exchange that goes something like this...

You: "Baby, you've been such a naughty girl teasing me with that short skirt showing off such a wonderful ass."

Her: "Mmmmmm... uh huh" (while she pretends to look coy) She didn't SAY anything, but her murmurs tell you she's enjoying the talk.

Then compare it to...

You: "Baby, you've been such a naughty girl teasing me with that short skirt showing off such a wonderful ass."

Her: "Hmm" (while she tightens her lips a little and perhaps furrows her brows slightly) Not such a great reaction, so you're better off toning it down next time to something more like: "Baby, your fabulous ass drives me crazy!" and see what response that gets.

As for full on moans... they're always good! No one moans in a bad way, so making her moan with your dirty talk means she's telling you how turned on she is.

4. What isn't being said

Just as important as what your girl tells you she likes, is what she doesn't say when she dislikes something.

Just because she isn't telling you to stop doesn't mean she wants you to continue.

This is a classic signal women use in general, because it means she can express that she's not all that interested in something without being rude or putting you off with negative talk. Once you realize this, you'll notice it happening more regularly.

As an example, you're MUCH more likely to tell her "use less teeth" when she's going down on you, than she is to say "that's nice, but it isn't doing much for me" when you're going down on her. It's just how women operate.

She doesn't want to discourage you from ever going down on her again by making you think she's not enjoying it.

Pg 87





So you need to pay attention to what doesn't get a reaction.

The same is true for dirty talk. If your girl isn't the voraciously talkative type, you'll be able to tell what she's not enjoying from what isn't said. Her murmurs and moans (or talk) will act as positive reinforcement when she does like something, and she'll be more silent when she doesn't like it.

This may sound cryptic to you, but women believe the absence of positive reinforcement is an adequate signal of what they don't like. And once you know to look for this signal, you should be able to see it clearly too!

Non Verbal Signals

We’re talking about body language here! Either on its own, or as part of a verbal signal (like in the example we gave above)... body language is a powerful tool used by women to let you know what they're thinking.

Of course, we all use body language all the time, but when it comes to sex or dirty talk, the signals are likely to be more exaggerated because they're more deliberate than unconscious.

For instance, when you're chatting with someone you don't like, you may unconsciously cross your arms or legs to form a barrier between the two of you, or sit or stand a little straighter to let them know you're not allowing yourself to relax. There are a hundred little signals you're probably not even aware you're using.

In bed, when women use body language as a signal it is likely more deliberate. It's a conscious attempt to make you aware of how she feels about something, so the signs will be obvious.

As usual, you'll find each girl slightly different, but here are some good examples of what to look out for when interpreting your girl's body language...

Let's start with her smile. A huge smile... a giggle... a coy grin... even a smirk are all indications she's enjoying your talk. Out and out laughter may not be so great (your girl may find the dirty talk just too cheesy for her), but it's better than a frown or pursed, tightly drawn lips.

Remember that a neutral expression could be one of those cases where she's trying to show you she isn't all that turned on without giving you an out and out negative reaction.

It's probably wise to take only positive responses as being a sign she's happy!

Her other facial expressions should be easy enough to read... furrowed brows or a single raised eyebrow probably means she's not too happy. A mischievous look or wide-eyed expression show you she's playing along and loving it :)

Facial expressions are particularly important to note when she's being quiet. They'll help you confirm whether or not her silence means she's trying to tell you she doesn't like it... or if she's just playing along without giving you a vocal response.

You can combine her facial and vocal reactions with her general body language for the complete picture.

A girl who is into what's being said to her will snuggle closer, play along with what you've asked her to do, run her hands through her hair, push her breasts forward, give you a playful butt wiggle... or any or all of the above and more!

If she starts to stiffen up, physically withdraw from you a little, recoil, look at you a little more sideways, give an impression that she's not too sure (eyes narrowing, a puzzled look, etc), or even just make an excuse to be somewhere else... then you're getting all the signs she isn't into what you're saying.

Pg 88





If you think this sounds like a lot to have to take in, then try not to over think it. As long as you're aware that you should be looking for signals, it will be easier for you to interpret them. You'll find it coming more naturally :)

Just ask!

Ultimately, the better you are at reading your girl's responses, the more effective your dirty talk will become.

But some women are wonderful mysteries that can't ever be fully unravelled... and some guys just never get the hang of interpreting the signals.

So what can you do if you find this happening to you?

Just come out and ask her. A few choice questions about what she likes will get rid of any guesswork. This isn't going to be easy for everyone, but you can raise it in an msn conversation, a text, or email if you'd rather not do it in person.

Ask her opinion on some of the more controversial words, phrases or terms... like slut, whore, cock, cunt, pussy, etc. Once you have her reactions to these you'll be able to temper down or amp up your dirty talk, knowing what she likes to hear. You don't need to go into specifics, but you'll get an idea from a few questions.

If you ask her in person, just don't forget the rule of omission! She may not say she doesn't like it, but if she doesn't say she does likes it, then it could be her way of being nice about it. Watch out for responses like, "I don't mind it", "It's ok, I guess", etc. They're noncommittal and could go either way.

In the end, being able to read your girl's signals with regards to dirty talk can only be a good thing. The better you know her and her nuances, the better you'll be able to give her exactly what she wants. And a happy girl likes to show her appreciation... which means everyone is ultimately a winner!

Chapter 6 – Turn to Compliments for Your Dirty Talk

So far we've covered how you can overcome your shyness in talking dirty to your girl, a bunch of different ways you can go about it, how to interpret her signals, and how you can mix it up a little depending on what she likes to hear.

But what if you're still having trouble figuring out what your girl really enjoys? Where do you look for inspiration for new ways of making her life sexier? How do you expand your repertoire when what you've already been saying to your girl is starting to get stale?

Well, the answer to all these (and more) is always found in compliments!!

It may sound trite to you, and it may even sound insincere when you're saying it, but everyone appreciates compliments! EVERYONE!

If you're rolling your eyes and thinking that it all seems a little cliché and stereotypical, then remember that there's truth behind every stereotype. Australians really DO say "G'day, mate", and Russians really DO drink a lot of vodka. They're clichés for a reason... because they describe a general behaviour!

And that's great news because compliments are easy and you'll know they work.

Bingo! Just like that you have the one thing you need to make sure your dirty talk is not only effective, but also provides you with a steady supply of new ways to make her feel special, wanted, and as sexy as hell.

Pg 89





Remember we emphasized earlier in (and throughout) this book that your dirty talk is for your girl, not for you?

Well using compliments is the perfect way to make sure you're doing this. Let's discuss how you can use this very simple technique for keeping it fresh in the bedroom every time...

The importance of complimenting women

So why should you use compliments in your dirty talk?

There are several reasons... and each one will help you understand why this tactic is an important one.

1. Everyone loves a compliment

We said this already, but it's worth saying again. Absolutely everyone loves being complimented!

How much better does it make you feel about yourself when someone says they love how you look in those jeans, or that your eyes are a stunning shade of blue/brown/green. Your confidence is boosted in that instant, as is your mood. One comment like that can really make your day!

Your goal in talking dirty to your girl is to make her feel sexy and wanted, to get her in the mood for some hot sex. And since you know compliments are going to make her feel better about herself, this is a sure fire way to boost her mood! You'd be crazy not to make the most of this technique.

2. Women's self consciousness is usually linked to how they look Insecurity is a mood killer like no other, and women (in general) tend to have poor self image when it comes to their looks. Even supermodels find flaws with how they look, so you can imagine what insecurities a regular girl has!

For girls, being naked with someone else means she can't hide that belly she wished was flatter, the knees she thinks look chunky, the boobs she wants to be bigger/fuller/perkier, the ass that isn't as smooth as it used to be...

ad infinitum.

Making her comfortable with the way you think she looks is PARAMOUNT to keeping her sexy mood.

Remember this as it's extremely important. If she thinks you find her sexy because you use your dirty talk to compliment how she looks, then she's going feel sexy.

Here's something a lot of guys don't realize... women fret about how they look much more than you would ever believe, and constant (or frequent) reassurance from you that you think she looks hot WILL NEVER GET

OLD.

You can literally never say it enough, because if you stop reminding her then she's just likely to think you've ceased to find her sexy. Seriously, she can't read your mind, and will be inclined to assume you're not as attracted to her anymore, when really you just think she knows how you feel.

These two little facts push the importance of using compliments in your dirty talk to a much more critical level. Not only do they make her feel sexy, and remind her how hot you think she is... but they STOP her from thinking you DON'T find her sexy, which is just as important.

Compliments are SO easy!

The really good news for you is that using compliments in your dirty talk is as easy as pie.

Let's start with compliments in general. Look at anyone you meet and you'll be able to find something you like about them. It's usually pretty simple on a complete stranger... and it's going to be even easier with your girl, because you already have a connection with her. There will be TONS of things you find fabulous!

Pg 90

So then you just need to think about your compliments in two ways... physical and nonphysical.

Physical compliments are just those specifically targeted to how she looks. Think about the following list: Smile, hair, nails, skin, eyes, mouth, legs, bum, boobs, eyes, feet, hands, stomach, neck, pussy, nipples, wrists, shoulders, knees, toes, fingers, nose, throat, chest, hips, thighs, calves, and back.

Each one of these physical attributes can be complimented and turned suggestively into dirty talk. I'll choose a couple of the more obscure ones at random and give you some examples: Nails:

1. "I love feeling your fantastically long nails dig into me when you're right in the throes of an amazing orgasm."

2. "Those awesome nails of yours certainly left their mark on me after last night. It's been an amazing reminder all day!"

3. "Your nails look fucking hot wrapped around my hard cock."

Skin:

1. "You have no idea how hot and smooth your skin feels when I plant kisses all over your body."

2. "I'm craving the feel of your silky skin on mine tonight as I grab that wonderful ass of yours and pull you to me."

3. "I can't get enough of your soft skin next to mine in bed."

Hips:

1. "I love grabbing onto those gorgeous hips of yours and pulling you onto my hard cock."

2. "I almost cum on the spot seeing your lovely hips bouncing you up and down on my cock."

3. "I can't wait to get my hands on those cute little/fabulously curvy hips tonight."

Simple!! Think about a body part and how it adds to your sexual experience, then talk about it!

Here's a top tip... is there any particular body part your girl is most self conscious about? Make a note if she's always complaining about how she doesn't like having a big butt, for example. Then remember to compliment her about that particular area in your dirty talk every now and then. (Don't do it too often or she'll fixate on it.) If you can make her feel sexy about even the parts of herself she doesn't like, then you're doing your job right!

The thing to really keep in mind is that girls feel sexy when they're feeling good about themselves. The more you tell her how hot and sexy she is, the more she is likely to believe it, which will get her in the mood a lot more often!

But don't forget about the nonphysical compliments to do with her attitude and actions.

This is where it's important to remember that everyone loves praise! And the list of things you can compliment your girl on is practically endless. Here are some examples to get you thinking:

 How well she sucks your dick

 How much you love her energy in bed

 How great her open attitude is

 How adventurous she is

 How she enjoys dressing up for you

 How she strips for you

 How much you enjoy is when she talks dirty to you

Pg 91





 How turned on you get from her moans of delight

 How she manages to turn anything into a sexy activity

 How her text messages today gave you a raging hard on

Etc!

And the more compliments you dish out, the more she's going to try to rise to the occasion. If you tell her how much her moans turn you on... she'll always do it. If you tell her how talented she is at taking your cock in her mouth... she'll continue living up to the reputation.

A little praise goes a LONG way! And conversely, if you never tell her what you're enjoying about her actions and attitudes, she's likely to give them up as wasted time.

Once again... remember that your dirty talk is for her, so always make her the focus of what you're saying!

Compliments will make that easier, because they're more specific to her, which is yet another reason for employing the technique :)

What if your girl doesn't like being complimented?

Ok, so what if your girl doesn't take compliments well? And it's a valid question, because some people are uncomfortable with being singled out for praise.

It's usually self consciousness or a lack of being praised in the past that leads people to reject nice comments like these. So just start out slow... every time you send a text message or email, begin it with "Hey sexy girl," or

"Hello gorgeous." The same goes with phone calls and personal greetings. This tells her you’re always thinking of her as sexy and gets her used to the idea that it’s a matter of fact.

Keep your compliments general and very frequent until she's more comfortable being regularly praised. Then you can make them more specific in your dirty talk. Once she's used to accepting the compliments, then you'll notice how amazing her responses to your dirty talk will become!

Chapter 7 – Dirty Talk in the Bedroom

So we just have one more thing left to cover when it comes to your dirty talk... and that is when you use it!

This chapter is all about talking dirty in the bedroom (as opposed to sending messages at other times to get your girl in the mood, which we’ll discuss in the last chapter), and to get the crux of that, you have to think about what your dirty talk is trying to achieve.

We've spoken already about it being a primer... to get her ready for some hot, fantastic sex, and keep her in that frame of mind! Of course, this is incredibly important for adding spice and flavour to your bedroom antics. It shows you're thinking about her all the time and that you want and desire her.

And we've emphasized how this dirty talk has to be all about her... so she knows she's special to you, which will make your efforts so much more successful. Believe is, every woman wants to hear that she has a gorgeous body and know how much you want to ravage it.

The more effort you put into making her feel special, the better her reactions will be... and the hotter your time together. And really, how much of an effort is it actually going to be to tell your girl how pretty she is? A little consideration and attention goes a very long way!

It might seem as though you're the one putting all the work in at this stage (although the rewards will make it all worth it!), but really you don't have to be entirely altruistic all the time.

Pg 92





Once your girl is comfortable if your dirty talk, you can use it to guide her during sex too... and if you do it right, you'll not only be telling her how you like it, you'll be turning her on too...

Telling her how you like it

Sex therapists and experts across the board all have the same comment to make about keeping things hot in the bedroom... communication. But just coming out and telling someone what does and doesn't work for you can be tricky ground. You don't want her to take offense because she thinks she was doing something wrong. Nor do you want to sound patronizing.

Your girl's faith in her own sexual abilities and how much you love being with her is what will make her enjoy herself, perform better, and be more interested in honing her skills. It's a delicate line to walk to let her know what she's not doing right, what she could improve on, and what you love her doing (although this last one is a little easier).

But if you incorporate your instructions in your dirty talk, that's another story!

So how do you do that? Well, you just need to remember a few things: 1. Positive Reinforcement

We mentioned that women are likely to tell you what they like, and then just not comment when they don't like something (rather than saying it outright). Take this cue and do the same thing yourself!

If you start complimenting her skills… telling her how much you enjoy that thing she does with her tongue, etc… then she's going to very quickly get the message about what makes you hard. Accompany her actions with groans of appreciation and she'll always know she's on track.

Then, when she does something you're not too turned on by, just stay silent. Or guide her back to something she was doing before with a comment like, "baby, it was so hot when you were pumping my shaft like that just before."

This sort of positive reinforcement not only serves as dirty talk, but lets her know how good she is, while guiding her away from actions you're not as turned on by.

A win-win scenario all round!

2. Never tell her you don't like something

By extension... if it's at all possible, and she's not actually hurting you, try not to tell her outright that she needs to improve in some way.

Ok, some women won't take offense at this, but do you really want find out the hard way that your girl is not one of those few? A much safer option is to stick with the positive reinforcement of what is working for you.

Besides... everyone changes all the time, and if you tell her you don't like doing something, you may find you want to try it out at a later stage. You don't want to burn your bridges! Stick with making sure she knows what you do like... women are fabulous at picking up signals like these, so you'll find it works out well for you.

One other note on using dirty talk to give your girl instructions... try not to use this sort of talk out of the bedroom. Remember that your talk is supposed to be about her and getting her in the mood. If you start texting her with messages like "I can't wait to have you suck my cock the way you do," she's just as likely to raise an eyebrow to herself and think "I'm sure you can't wait", as she is to be excited about the thought of having to give you a blowjob when she gets home.

Pg 93





This may work some of the time, but if she's even a little bit tired or in a slightly bad mood, she's going to resent the implication that she has to then come home and spend energy giving you pleasure.

Of course she'll want to do just that if you can set her mood, but letting her know that you expect it is the fastest way to make sure it doesn't happen.

This can't be emphasized enough. Save the instructions and specific requests for the bedroom and when the two of you are in the throes... and then phrase them in a positive context!

Bring out the compliments again

When the two of you are naked and about to enjoy each other's talents, this is when your girl is likely to be most self conscious about how she looks...

So, being in the bedroom is the perfect opportunity for you to pepper your dirty talk with compliments!

You really have no idea how much women think about how they look... and worry and stress that you won't find us attractive because we aren’t a size zero, or because we’re not Swimsuit Illustrated models. And the size zero girls worry that their small frame won't be as much of a turn on as someone with big boobs. It's pretty much a constant struggle for a lot of women, so you should never underestimate the power of telling your girl how gorgeous you think she looks.

Really concentrate on her appearance with your bedroom dirty talk, and how much she turns you on… how much you love her round ass/flat stomach/fabulous breasts/milky skin/lovely legs/sumptuous curves/etc. If she can see directly that she's having a hardening effect on you, she will believe your compliments, and it will make her confident enough with her appearance to be as sexy as hell for you. The more confident she is that you're not judging her round belly, the more likely she is to throw herself into your activities with abandon.

This is particularly important if you enjoy positions that she perhaps isn't as happy with because she feels it shows her in an unflattering way. You might think this is unlikely, that your girl doesn’t care, but seriously … it happens!

If your girl doesn't like the way her ass looks, she may not want you staring at it while fucking her from behind (certainly a problem if you love doggie)! So use your dirty talk to compliment her lovely ass and how sexy it looks to you. If she's sure you love looking at it, she’ll be happy to be fucked from behind.

It's a great psychology you can use frequently with your dirty talk, and once again, everyone wins because she feels awesome about what you've told her... and you get guide her into doing what you like :) Have fun and tell her what you're doing if you're at a loss for words When it comes down to it, talking dirty in the bedroom is probably going to be the most difficult for you to actually go through with when you're just starting out... especially if you're a bit shy about it all.

It might be harder to say the words when you're right there with your girl, hearing your own voice echo around the room… everything you've learned could pop out of your head in the heat of the moment.

So the thing to remember is... don't worry! You'll have more opportunities to work at it, and she's not going to judge you! As long as you're making some noise, she'll be pleased (cue the moans and groans). And it's supposed to be fun, so don't let it stress you out.

Pg 94





Something that might help of you're at a loss is just telling her what you're doing to her. You have all the material you need right there with comments like:

"I can feel how wet you’re getting on my fingers"

"Mmmmm... I'm sliding my hard cock into your wonderfully wet pussy"

"I love watching my cock slide in and out of you like this"

"You should see how your pussy is gripping onto me... it's hot!"

And so on. Literally commenting on what is happening means you'll always have something to say! It's just as good for dirty talk as anything else when it comes down to it. And you can be pretty sure you won't be offending her, since you're just verbalizing what you're actually doing.

Really the important thing to remember is that you want to keep things positive. Keep praising her and complimenting her, and you're sure to get good reactions from your girl, which will mean the two of you will get more of what you want in the bedroom, and less of what you're not too bothered about!

Chapter 8 – Dirty Messages

One of the really fun things about dirty talk is that it is much, much more than just what you can say out loud to your girl when you're together.

Wherever forms of communication have existed, they have been used to send messages of love and lust.

In the past, lovers used to write letters to each other to keep the thrill alive . history is positively littered with love poems and notes! . especially when they were separated by vast distances. And let's not forget the love notes you used to pass in school. It was always such a thrill to be on the receiving end of a scribbled declaration like that! And what made it even better was that you could keep the note... reliving the thrill whenever you wanted by reading it over and over again.

Then, with the telephone came phone sex, where you described to the other person what you were doing or wearing, or what you would like to do to them… perfect for people with a good imagination and ideal for couples separated by distance.

Now, with cell phones and the Internet, we have text messaging, picture messaging, email, image sharing, videos, webcamming, and just about anything you can dream up!

And this is excellent news for you, because the instant nature of communication now means you don't have to wait for your girl to traipse down to the mailbox for a love letter, or hang around while she gets home from work to answer the phone. You can thrill her at any moment of any day with a quick, dirty little text, or a picture you took on your break at work with your camera phone.

Dirty messages are an absolutely fantastic way of boosting your girl's mood, it's fun for you to do, it's not in any way embarrassing or difficult, you can escalate the intensity of your messages over time, your notes are instant, and your girl can hold onto them for a while to continue to get her thrills throughout the day. Perfect!

So let's have a look at just how you can use dirty messages to give your girl a million little thrills a day and really get her in the mood or make sure you're never too far from her mind...

Pg 95





1. Love Letters

Love letters are a classic way you can let your girl know how you feel and what you would like to do to her.

You might think love letters have had their day in the sun . who puts actual pen to paper these days anyway? .

but don't discount them right away.

Imagination and initiative are a huge turn on for women. If you take the initiative to actually write a letter and post it to your girl, she is going to be blown away when she collects your note from her pile of boring bills in the mail.

And it doesn't have to be long or extremely well written (not everyone is a poet). Imagine your girl opening a note that simply reads something along the lines of:

"Sweetheart, I can't get you out of my mind and just cannot wait for each chance I get to run my hands over your fabulous body, disrobing and tasting every inch of you. Mmmmm! Until I see you again... Your man"

See? You don't need to write a sonnet and it doesn't have to be some sort of soppy cry-fest. Any dirty talk will do... just make her the focus. The point is the time you took to write it and mail it. It'll give her a thrill, something she can talk to her friends about, and it'll let her know you're thinking about how hot she is all the time.

2. Dirty notes

Then there are dirty notes. It's an often-overlooked little strategy, but you'll never believe the reaction you can get from leaving your girl a dirty little note in her work bag.

Grab a scrap of paper or a post-it note and scribble something down on it like "You're hot, baby, and I can't wait to ravage you tonight"... and leave it in her bag, or in her cereal bowl, the cutlery drawer, her jewelry box (wherever!!). At some point in the day she'll be surprised by the note, she'll think of you and how much you want her... and right there you've inspired her to contemplate how the two of you are going to go at it when you see each other next.

That puts a smile on her face and thoughts in her head. Exactly what you want to achieve!

3. Emails and Instant Messaging

Most of us are on computers the majority of the day. We go to work and use them... we come home and use them... and we connect through our email accounts (most of us have more than one).

What could be more simple and sexy than to send your girl dirty emails through the day (don't use her work email though!)? Emails are easy to pick up, quick to write and read, will put a secret smile on her face, and she can keep them to reread over and over.

Imagine her checking her Gmail or Hotmail and seeing something like "I'm hard right now thinking about caressing your tight, wet pussy".

You can really have fun with sending emails, too. Send her a series throughout the day... describing each thing you want to do to her when you see her. Something along the lines of: Email 1:

The second you walk through the door I'm going to take your face in my hands, kiss you deeply, and start stripping you of those work clothes.

Pg 96





Email 2:

With you wonderfully naked, I'm going to kiss your luscious breasts... slowly moving my hands down to your pretty pussy.

Email 3:

Moving my fingers in and out of you, you'll be nice and wet and moaning for my cock before I even take my clothes off.

Etc

You can spin a whole scenario over a bunch of emails through the day to spark her mood, and keep bringing her thoughts back to you. The perfect thing about emailing dirty messages is that you can be as tame or as explicit as you like (again, though, don't use yours or her work email addresses!), it doesn't take much time, you both probably have excellent access to the internet all day, and you can send her these little sexy thrills at any time of the day or night.

You can do the same thing with instant messaging. If you and your girl both have access to something like MSN, AIM or Gmail’s chat, you can get quite creative with sexy conversations when you’re apart. Because it’s instantly interactive, this is the perfect way to try new phrases or gauge her response to more explicit levels of talk. Make a note of the kind of terminology she uses in her messages and take that as a guide.

4. Text and picture messaging

Just like email, everyone these days has a cell phone capable of text and picture messaging. And this really is the perfect medium for your dirty messages. Cell phones are with us all the time and everyone enjoys receiving a personal text. You and your girl can be anywhere at any time and you have instant contact.

And, again, you can have a lot of fun with texts. She might be in a boring meeting when you send her a text saying "Last night was so hot... I'm still hard!", or at the hair dressers when she gets the message "I'll be grabbing a fistful of that pretty hair tonight as I kiss you deeply". The options are pretty much endless and you can text your girl whenever you're inspired to do so... on the train, from overseas, at work, waiting at the dentist.

Whenever you have a spare moment!

Let’s not forget picture messaging, too. Most phones have cameras that are just waiting for an opportunity to snap private pics, which can then be messaged to your girl through the day or night.

Shots (or even videos) of your hard cock with the tagline "thinking of you", make an excellent surprise message. Or you can take a picture of the blindfold you want to use on her that night, the bed you'll be having sex on... really anything you can think of to inspire her mood.

5. Phone Sex

When you think of phone sex, you probably have visions of calling your girl to ask what she's wearing. Lol! But you can make things a little more interesting than the cliché if phone sex is something you both enjoy.

First off, you may find phone sex a little intimidating initially, and in fact it may never be something you're entirely comfortable with. The same is true for your girl. Whereas most people will have fun with dirty notes, texts or emails, phone sex has a lot less anonymity. You're speaking directly to your girl, so you need some confidence to carry it off.

Try describing for her what you would like to do when you see her next. Or how you're jerking off to the thought of her. You'll be able to tell from her responses if she's really into it or not.

Pg 97





Do not keep trying to make her have phone sex if she isn't interested. It will become a chore and kill the mood.

And if it isn't something you enjoy, then just let her know. Plenty of couples love talking dirty to each other over the phone, though, so it's worth giving it a go!

There are also alternatives to full on phone sex. Dirty voicemail messages are a fantastic way to leave your lover a surprise. Pick a time when you know she can't answer her phone and let her know how much you "miss her fantastic smile and the way she makes you so damn hard".

6. Webcamming

Last but not least, there's webcamming. Since most laptops these days come with a built-in webcam, streaming video has become a popular way to flirt online. Webcamming is easy via MSN or Skype, or any number of other programs, and some people have really taken to the possibilities this presents.

But webcamming isn't for everyone. It's quite voyeuristic, which makes it more appealing to some people, and less to others. If you haven't tried it, it's worth giving it a go, but bear in mind that it won't be everyone's preference.

Remember, too, that there are different ways to webcam. It might be that your girl likes performing for you but isn't interested in seeing you on the other side, or vice versa. This is definitely a case in which communication will help you find each other's preferences. Just ask her what turns her on and what doesn't! And again, don't try to make her webcam with you if it isn't enjoyable for her.

Things to consider...

One of the things that makes dirty messages a fun form of dirty talk is that, because you're not in direct contact with your girl (not saying things to her face) it's easy to overcome any embarrassment you might have. You'll also find yourself becoming bolder as time goes on... taking dirtier pictures and saying dirtier things as you judge whether or not this sort of thing turns her on.

Better yet, if you still haven't quite been able to talk dirty to your girl out loud and in person, you can use dirty messaging as the perfect training ground for building your confidence. If she is responding quickly to what you tell her, then you know you're onto something. If she's escalating the messages, then take it as a cue for you to do so too.

Just about everyone is more comfortable expressing themselves from behind the security and anonymity of a note, so take this opportunity to learn as much about your girl's preferences as you can, as well as building your own confidence in talking dirty.

Keeping things different and interesting is part of what dirty talk (and dirty messaging) is all about, so don't just pick one of these methods... use all of them at different times and for different reasons! Figure out which ones elicit the best responses and which ones might need a different approach.

And, as usual, remember to try and keep the focus on her as much as possible!

Dirty Talk

 Practice of using graphic word imagery to heighten sexual pleasure, act out fantasy, and amplifying sexual emotion in the context of a sexual situation

o

Powerful way to evoke potent sexual emotions

o

Powerful way to feed her fantasy of being submissive and giving herself to her man o

Keeps her mind in the present and let's her give up responsibility for what's happening. This makes it easier for her to give in to orgasm.

o

All women want to do it, even the ones who act pure and innocent in public!

 All women have a fantasy of being sexually submissive to a man who is a sexual threat o

Man who is a sexual threat (in a good way)

 Man who takes charge sexually

 Man who evokes powerful emotions

 Man who is unpredictable

 Man who assumes responsibility for what's happening and makes it ok for her to finally act out all her crazy sexual fantasies

 Man who never shows all his cards at once and leaves her wondering what's going to happen next

 This is the type of man who she can't stop thinking about

 This is the man she tells all her friends about

 Women are not sexually turned on by safe, boring and predictable men

 Dirty Talk is one way to demonstrate you are a sexual threat

o

We can liberate her and let her be the slut she wants to be in the bedroom while giving her the assurance that you will respect her the same in the morning

 Many men are afraid to talk dirty to women

o

They fear that she'll take it wrong

o

Some men are conservative and think it's disrespectful

Pg 99

o

They fear she will judge him

o

Truth is women want to talk dirty, in many cases more than men, they just don't want to initiate it. This would take away her being submissive to you. She wants you to take charge.

 Being congruent with dirt talk

o

Can't be hesitant or apologetic

o

Say it with authority and confidence

o

Must be authentic

 It's all about context

o

You can get away with saying dirty things and calling her slutty names in the context of a sexual situation

o

Can say in the bedroom

 "You're my dirty little bitch and you're going to let me fuck your pussy hard."

o

Cannot use same words in non sexual context

 Bad: "Wash my clothes you dirty little bitch"

o

It's all about context!

 Choosing your words wisely

o

Don't use proper words like Penis and Vagina or silly words like Boobs or Willy o

Use sexy dirty words like pussy, dick, cock, tits

o

Do not call her degrading names like cunt, or other words that may offend her

 Starting out with Dirty Talk

o

Start out slow

 "Just thinking about you makes my cock hard"

 "I can't wait to feel your dripping wet pussy"

 "Your pussy makes my cock so hard"

 "I want to be inside of you so bad"

 Over Time you can work in more. Examples:

o

As you undress her say to her:

 "You're so naughty letting me touch you like this. You're going to be my naughty little slut and let me put my hard cock inside your pussy"

o

As you put yourself inside her:

 "You're such a bad girl letting me stick my hard cock inside your wet pussy. Your pussy feels so good with my cock deep inside."

o

As you fuck her doggystyle and pull her hair:

 "You like it when I fuck you hard. You like it when I fuck you like the dirty little bitch that you are."

o

More examples:

 "Come on my cock (name)"

 "Your pussy feels good and wants to come hard on my cock"

 "My hard cock is so deep inside you"

 "I can feel how bad your pussy wants to come on my cock"

 Getting her to participate

o

Many women will respond immediately and play along

o

Use the following to get her to participate

o

Tease her with shallow strokes and say:

Pg 100





 "I want you to tell me how bad you want my cock inside you. You're my naughty girl and I want you to tell me how bad you want me to fuck you"

o

While you are fucking her hard:

 "Do you like it when your man fucks you hard? Tell me how hard you want me to pound your pussy!"

 "I'm going to make your pussy come on my cock. Tell me how bad your pussy wants to come!"

 Dirty Talk in text messages and email

o

Great way to evoke powerful sexual emotions and build anticipation

 Remember building sexual anticipation is a great way to lead her mind to orgasm.

o

Here's an example from my personal experience

o

Started slow because relationship was early and wanted to build up o

Text conversation that started about me going for a jog:

 Me: "Just got back, I'm all sweaty. Wish I could take a hot shower with my sexy girl right now. Our naked bodies rubbing together, my arms around you holding you tight, kissing your lips and down your neck, feeling myself slip inside your wet... whoa I better stop.

Just f--king f--k me, already

Dear Men of Craigslist,

Look, I know you men have it difficult. Women are just about impossible to understand, much less please. In a post-feminist society, you never know exactly what you should be doing. Women are bloody picky, I know we are. It can be scary, too, when women freak out about what appear to be benign issues. And men who do their best to be respectful, female-positive humans, I salute you, I do.

But please, please just f--k me already. Honestly, I appreciate your thoughtfulness. I like that you want to take things slow. I can totally get behind the idea of emotional connection, but dearjesusinheaven, f--k ME. We've done dinner and drinks. We've gone dancing. We've cuddled and watched a movie. I'm wearing a low cut shirt and you've been staring at my breasts all night. Goodgodalmighty, get to it and f--k me.

When we get hot and heavy, please take charge. Please, please f--k me. Trust me, I'm not going to just lie still -

I'll get involved. But don't make me force your hand into my panties. That makes me feel like a rapist. We've been kissing for a half hour and your hand keeps grazing my ass. That's nice, but it's time to move forward. Get Pg 101





on top of me. Don't make me get on top right out of the gate and start bobbing up and down on your cock like I'm practicing some crazy new aerobic yoga because YOU won't go down on me. Roll on top and start dry humping like a good boy should. Don't gently suck my nipples and then pull back when I moan with pleasure.

You being coy is totally not what I want. It's not what WE want.

1. It's OK for you to make noise. Otherwise, we feel like we are f--king a ninja. Unless you actually are a ninja, and have sneaked into our rooms with vibrating nanuchaku and zippered black pajamas, please, please make some noise. If you're banging a woman, and she's crying out and saying your name and moaning, and you can't even manage a grunt, she's going to feel like an idiot. You don't have to make the sounds she is making, but do SOMETHING. You know how when you are watching porn, and the girl does something great to the guy and the guy kind of goes "Ah!", half grunt, half yell? That's HOT. Do that. Whisper our name (assuming you know it) gruffly. Groan against her neck when you're in missionary position. You don't have to grunt like a mountain gorilla, but if you are totally mute, she's going to get worried.

2. Most women like dirty talk, in addition to the grunting. If you'd like to get some dirty talk going, ask her if she likes the way you f--k her. If she responds well, continue with something like, "I love f--king you. God, you look so f--king hot." Is she still moaning in response? "Your tits are so beautiful." Does that work? If she doesn't respond well to the term "tits", you might have to stop there. If she keep moaning or responding, pass Go and collect $200. Try the following:

"Oh, god. Your pussy is SO tight."

"You're so wet - are you wet because you like the feel of my cock ramming you?"

"I think I'm going to come inside you. I'm going to fill up your little c---." It doesn't matter that you're wearing a condom; we LOVE hearing this.

If all of those work, you can then progress to things like "sexy little bitch" and "dirty whore". Tread carefully, but please, tread. Do not tiptoe. Do not sit down. Charge.

Your Most Powerful Tool In The Bedroom - David Shade

During my last two years of college, I had a college sweetheart who I found to be very cute and sexy. She also happened to be very intelligent, very high self esteem, and extremely sexual. We had very good sex. We did it often and always had simultaneous orgasms.

But here's where it gets really interesting...

One day she said to me "As you know, I love horses. Well, I also admire how they are very animalistic when they have sex. And when we do it doggy style, I sometimes imagine that I am a horse and that I am being very animalistic."

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. But of course I said "Oh good Baby, I love that you are able to feel animalistic." I had certainly heard that women like to be "animalistic." I never really thought that they went as far as to imagine they were an animal!

So, the next time we did it doggy style, I said to her "Oh yeah Baby, you are being very animalistic!" She got even more excited. I couldn't believe I was saying this. I took a big gulp of courage and I said "You are so animalistic, just like a horse. Whine like a horse!"

She started making horse noises! And she started going crazy!

Pg 102

What do horses do? Whine? Wee Wee? I dunno.

I continued "Oh yeah Baby, make like a horse! You are getting fucked like an animal!"

She went ballistic. She started screaming in multi-orgasmic ecstasy.

I couldn't fucking believe it. It was so "foreign" to me. But hell, it worked, and very powerfully. Truth is found in reality.

My next girlfriend had no interest in horses, but she did like to be animalistic. I altered what I said to fit the situation. It worked amazingly well. I was on to something. I varied it further with each subsequent girlfriend. I moved it from being animalistic to being slutty. That worked even better.

I found that the more vulgar and raunchy I got, the more excited they would get. Over the years I enjoyed refining it even further.

Now to the present...

I was an invited guest speaker at the 2006 Montreal "Cliffslist Convention." I really enjoyed meeting everyone and it was a pleasure to be there. My presentation was about how to bring out the ruthlessly expressive sexual creature in your woman.

In my presentation, one of the points that I stressed was the following...

Your most important tool in the bedroom is not your tool, it is your voice. Specifically: Dirty Talk. And it is very powerful.

Incorporate this, and it will skyrocket your results...

YOUR MOST POWERFUL TOOL IS DIRTY TALK. By far.

It is that mental stimulation that is so critical. It serves to bring out that decadent, primal, carnal, natural sexual woman in her. It makes the entire experience so exciting. However, some guys have warped limiting beliefs, or timidness, or just have no idea how to go about it.

The following email is an example:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

email from J:

Hi David, I have been with my girl for over a year now and I have yet to give her an orgasm. Now let me tell you that I have never lasted in any relationship more than 6 months tops. This girl is beyond special. I love her with all my heart, yet I can't show it in the bedroom.

Every time I want to pleasure her I can't hold in my own orgasm long enough. Oh, she says things like, "It's alright, Honey." But it doesn't feel alright at all. And even though she comforts me it still doesn't make me feel alright about myself in the bedroom because I am not able to give her what she deserves. She has to give it to herself because of my inexperience. It stinks.

Furthermore, I can't find that deep spot everyone keeps talking about. Maybe I just don't know it. I don't even know how to dirty talk properly without thinking I'll hurt her feelings. I mean I'm a nice guy, and she knows that; however, I would like to be able to tell her something dirty every once in a while without my chest feeling so tight.

Pg 103

I never even curse unless I'm quoting something like a joke. That's why I'm so high strung I think is the right thing to say. Like I said even though she says it's alright, I don't feel aright when it comes to going into the bedroom. How can I make myself feel as good as I do on a daily basis and transfer that into the bedroom to make myself, as well as my girl, feel good?

I would sure appreciate it if you could give me something to do, so I don't feel like I'm a useless lump in the bedroom while she has to give herself her own orgasm while I'm sitting right there next to her. Thank you for your time.

My comments:

It is amazing that your woman has stayed with you for an entire year. All of the truly sexual women would have left a long time ago. You are doing everything wrong.

You are using your "tool" to try to satisfy her. Even if you could last longer, it wouldn't work anyway, because you are not leading her mentally.

She has to masturbate when she is with you in order for her to get off. How pathetic.

I am not surprised you can't "find" her deep spot. You may have been stimulating the right spot, but because you do not affect her mentally or emotionally, she is not responding to you at all.

Unfortunate that your chest feels tight when you think about talking dirty to her. You are unable to understand that women actually LIKE dirty talk. You have many warped beliefs about women and about sexuality. You need a lot of work.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

email from T:

You say not to be a horndog and to not talk dirty in the living room. But you used to talk dirty to women over the phone. Could you be more clear on the difference between being a horndog and what you do? I heard parts of your cd's. You are a total horndog on these CDs. Please clarify yourself. When and where is it appropriate, man?

T

My comments:

You obviously are not a client of mine. If you had purchased my audio CDs, you would understand all of this.

You would have heard me explain the context in which dirty talk must take place. There is a time and place for everything.

You would have also heard me explain the difference between a horndog and a truly sensual lover. Being a horndog is being selfish and inconsiderate. A horndog is a turnoff to women. A truly sensual lover, however, is extremely exciting for a woman.

I'll give you two examples that contrast the horndog to the true lover...

Many women test for horndogs by saying something sexual and seeing how he replies. Let's say that a woman you just met in a night club tests you by saying:

"How do you feel about being dominant? Are you comfortable with that?"

The horndog would reply with: "Oh yeah, Baby, I'll give it to you good! I'll give ya something you can ride."

Turn off!

Pg 104

But the sensual lover would reply: "How do you feel about being submissive? Are you comfortable with surrendering to your strong man?" You see, he does not take the bait, but instead, he challenges her back.

That was an example of what a more mature woman would test with. A young woman would probably test by saying something more clumsy and less refined:

"What's your favourite position?"

The horndog would reply with: "I'd bend you over and fuck you hard Baby."

But the sensual lover would reply: "That depends."

When she asks for clarification, he would reply: "There is a time and place for everything. When we are feeling close and sensual, we would enjoy missionary as we gaze deeply into each other’s eyes. (Gaze deeply into her eyes.) And when we feel naughty and horny, we would enjoy doggy to be ruthlessly expressive."

Every question is an opportunity for a pattern :-)

email from M:

Dear David,

I am in need of your wisdom.

I’ve recently just split up from the girl I been seeing for a few weeks, she was great, got to like her a lot. I’ve been looking at attraction techniques from other sites which worked well, but I could see things weren't like they were at the start, all of sudden she started seeing less and less of me and she stopped the sex. I really want her back but I know I have to break it off and learn by my mistakes for next 1, so I never want this to happen again. I just read 1 of your recent emails (10 Biggest Mistakes Men Make In The Bedroom). You pointed out a few mistakes I’ve done.

For 1. I’ve read from another site 'never give a girl what she asks for', so during sex she asked Her: "Say something nice to me"

My Reply: "Your pussy feels good"

I get the feeling she was looking for something else? Does this put me under the 'horn dog'.

#2 at a separate time a week later while sex she asked

Her: "I really like you (my name)"

My Reply: "Well actually I like me too"

I only wanted to get her to like me more. I’m feeling little confused, wots the difference between a 'horn dog'

and 'talking dirty'?

Cheers

M

My comments:

You got it ALL wrong. You obviously have no idea how women work, at least sexually.

NEVER belittle what a woman says when she is trying to make the experience more exciting, or giving you a genuine compliment.

In the things she said, she was simply trying to become closer to you. She wanted to hear what any woman would want to hear. Hell, she was helping you out! She was actually trying to tell you what you should be saying to a woman.

Pg 105

But your replies were inconsiderate and disrespectful. In fact, you pushed her away. That is why she is gone.

Your future will be very dry until you take on the correct knowledge and beliefs that will draw women closer to you, not push them away.

You really need help. The correct help.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

email from S:

I can tell that there is something lacking in our sex life. It could be that my girlfriend wants me to talk dirty to her in bed. But I am concerned that she will be insulted. I love her very much and I don't want to insult her, but I really want the sex to be good. Do you cover this in your cds?

S

My comments:

In the bedroom, things may start out sweet and loving and romantic. As she becomes more turned on, the context begins to change. When she becomes highly aroused, the context has completely changed. Everything you say in the context of heightened sexual arousal is interpreted by her in a completely different way.

Remember this. Burn this into your brain...

IN THE CONTEXT OF HEIGHTENED SEXUAL AROUSAL EVERYTHING YOU SAY IS TAKEN IN A

COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY

It will server to arouse her even more and magnify the excitement. She will not be offended, if you do it properly and in the correct context.

And I sense that you are afraid that you are going to lose her. You are walking on egg shells hoping that you won't make some mistake that will screw it up. No woman is going to respect that.

If you are acting out of fear, you are not BEing a Man. Instead, act out of passion for pleasing her. BE a Man and assert your masculinity that will make the relationship even more exciting for both of you.

email from Kash in Germany:

Hi David,

I have a success story I'm going to share with you. I bought your audio program on dirty talk a couple of months ago, out of curiosity. Which was what had scared me and at the same time fascinated me to see how dirty women can REALLY get!

Now just yesterday all that listening and mental practicing of using dirty talk came handy. I had a hot 22 year old date on the phone, we couldn’t meet since she had a long day of travelling and some guests at her home.

We just talked for a while and while we did, she was feeling me out on how open I am for new things. I said I'm very open for new things, which made her excited. In fact I'm willing and eager to learn new things, and if there are things that I don't like, I still might try it to see if I might think different about it later.

Which got her even more excited. So she started asking me what I was wearing. She initiated telephone sex in our 5th call. THATS when all your audio advice started coming handy.

I had her coming on the phone two times this morning, and we're meeting up next week to physically enhance what we started over the phone.

Giving women this type of pleasure really IS a gift.

Pg 106

Thanks a lot David!

Kash

My comments:

Women are highly sexual creatures. They love dirty talk.

It is unusual to find one who specifically initiates phone sex, but they exist. And when they do, you better be ready for the job.

Some women may hint at phone sex by saying something like "Are you laying down on your bed?" The vast majority of women will not specifically suggest it or hint at it, but they WILL respond when you correctly initiate it. And they love it. They end up screaming in orgasmic ecstasy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

email from Justin in California:

David,

I just have to tell you about my girl.

She is the first girl I've had phone sex with on a regular basis, and I used your phone sex techniques with her.

I've made her come when I count to ten, which was AWESOME. I also called her my slut who only wants to get fucked over the phone.

So when I was at her house, I just played off that, she'd do anything I'd tell her. She called me master, she'd come when I told her to, and I haven't even done your trick with the clit, it's just the way I dominate her and how she wants to be dominated.

Of all the advice I've read about girls, yours is the most fulfilling and true.

Thanks for your time, please keep putting out shit that makes a night with me unforgettable, I'll tell her to write you a thank you letter, so you can have some serious bragging rights, cuz what guy doesn't think he's good in bed?

Justin

My comments:

Awesome. You led her through the mental sexual experience on the phone, and then when you were with her, you continued the dirty talk and she was highly responsive to you. Awesome job. Your woman is truly enjoying her sexuality. You have made the world a better place.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testimonial from Daniel G. in CO :

There is a lot of great advice available to men related to dating, relationships and sex, however David Shade distinguishes himself from the rest in that he focuses such great detail on seldom discussed and often misunderstood subjects such as dirty talk, role playing and fantasy, dominance and submission, and threesomes

- among others.

His explanation of the mind-body connection, and its relationship to these topics often unfairly tabooed by society, initially really challenged many of my misconceptions and limiting beliefs about them, but ultimately helped me to open myself up to a reality of powerful possibilities.

Through some of my own recent experiences, I now have a much better understanding about and acceptance of the reality that these things are actually normal and healthy expressions of human sexuality and that when done Pg 107





in the proper contexts are things that so many women secretly crave, despite often being reluctant, afraid or embarrassed to discuss.

In addition to these insights, I've also learned some amazing physical sexual techniques, several of which I've never found in any of the many books and web posts that I've read.

If you are serious about taking things to new levels, of learning some great ways to really amplify a woman's (and your own) total experience and of setting yourself apart from "all of the other guys" then I highly recommend David Shade's Masterful Lover Manual and Audio CDs.

My comments:

Thank you Daniel.

Isn't it liberating to have these empowering beliefs?

Remember guys, after an emotionally powerful sexual experience, you absolutely MUST do "post coital re-bonding." You have to hold her close, and tell her how beautiful she is to you, and tell her how close she makes you feel to her, yadda yadda.

This is critical. After a very moving experience, she has to know that you still see her as the sweet loving feminine woman that she wants you to see her as.

Exhibitionism for the Shy

Hot talk has benefits beyond what one might initially expect:

It's true that hot talk is a powerful turn-on for many people, and that's an excellent reason to use it. But more importantly, erotic talk lets you communicate about sex without sounding clinical or detached. Today I can ask for exactly what I want sexually, and learn my partner's preferences, via direct questioning and fantasy talk - as well as through non-verbal ways of communicating. I know that communicating this way will maintain - even heighten - our level of arousal.

I suggests becoming more comfortable with erotic talk by talking to yourself while masturbating. If you try this and it feels awkward to you, then you might consider taking her sage advice on overcoming verbal shyness: If you're so shy that words just won't come out, start with sounds. Erotic moans and murmurs can turn a lover on as much as naughty stories, and they're a wonderful way for you to get used to making some noise. You can incorporate this into masturbation. Especially if you think erotic words or phrases while you coo and gasp, you will find that as you get more turned on, the words will superimpose themselves onto the sounds. Like magic, instead of vocalizing "Uhn! Uhn!" you'll find yourself saying "Yes! Yes!" - then maybe "More! Harder! Give it to me!"

Once you've gotten some level of comfort with erotic words, I recommend hot telephone calls with your lover as a good place to start out with him or her:

Another useful trick when beginning to talk with a partner is to do it live, but over the phone. You will have a cloak of privacy that respects your shyness yet doesn't shore it up. Arrange a time you can feel comfortable exploring telephone play. If your partner has requested phone sex or dirty talk, great - but you might still want to talk about it before you start dialling, if only to reassure yourself that the timing is right and that your lover's Pg 108





response will be positive. Otherwise, you run the risk of putting your partner on the spot, perhaps rendering him or her as tongue-tied as you're trying to learn not to be!

Phone sex can be very smutty, highly romantic, or anything in between. Nasty and starry-eyed, naughty and nice, aren't either/or options - they exist on a continuum. In fact, who says you can't be naughty and romantic at the same time?

Even if you and your partner have never masturbated in each other's presence, you might want to try it over the phone. Touch yourself and describe what you're doing; ask him or her to direct you; direct him or her. You can pretend you're together making love, or you can pretend you're strangers. You can ask for things you're shy about when face-to-face; you can describe your ideal lovemaking to each other.

Of course, you can do all this in person too. Picking up the phone first, before the face-to-face encounter, is optional - but it often helps if you find that in person you get too easily distracted by all your wonderful options for non-verbal communication. As fabulous as kissing is, it's hard to make yourself understood when your lips are pressed against your lover's. Phone sex forces you to talk - or at least moan and sigh - because you can't touch or see each other's expressions. Besides, phone sex is a hot alternative whether you're shy or bold.

Pay attention to the voice you use when you talk during masturbation. It doesn't matter what you say – try repeating the phrase "Oh, yes" during masturbation, giving it every erotic inflection you can. Do any of these tones feel more erotic to you? If you find one that does, explore it some more - narrate a fantasy, talk to an imaginary partner, or say anything sexy that comes into your head. You want to find elements of hot talk that make you hotter, and masturbation is the very best time to do this - especially if you feel self-conscious experimenting this way with your partner.

When you're watching erotic movies, especially porn, notice how often the actor's erotic effectiveness depends not on what s/he says, but how s/he says it; the difference between a poorly-delivered, clumsy line and a persuasive one is often the skill with which the actor conveys erotic emotion....

You can also convey nuance verbally by being more descriptive. Once you can utter one hot word, you're set to embroider it into phrases and sentences.

If you say "Fuck" while having sex it will convey your turn-on in one way; if you say "Fuck me" you'll give a somewhat different impression; if you add specifics: "Fuck me slowly," "Fuck me hard," "Fuck me now," "Fuck me up against the wall," you'll begin to get control of the word's erotic power - you'll be able to convey what you want and how you want it.

Similarly, if you load your sex talk with adjectives - "your hot, wet, dripping, hungry pussy" - and descriptive phrases, you'll weave a stronger erotic spell.

Sexy Talk for Men & Women with Exercises

Any woman who is lucky enough to know will tell you: Nothing is more exciting than talking sexy to the woman you love and having her talk sexy to you. Nothing. The right words at the right time can start a fire burning inside of her that feels like it will never go out. It can make her breathless. Insatiable. Unstoppable. And it can do the same thing for you....

Simple sentences such as, "I love to look at your body," "I want you," "I need you," or "I want to make love to you" can dramatically change the course of an evening, and sometimes, the course of an entire relationship.

You've probably thought about saying things like this to your partner many times, but could you imagine actually doing it?

Pg 109





Do you wish you could turn to your partner and say, "I need to get inside of you," "You make me so hot," "I love to look at your beautiful pussy," "I want to feel your tongue on my penis," or "Suck me"? Do you wish you could read him sexy poetry or passages from an erotic novel? Do you wish you could whisper dirty words in her ear? It's pretty exciting just thinking about it, isn't it?

Although it may seem from the last two quoted paragraphs that this book might be somewhat basic, Talk Sexy to the One You Love ended up surprising me with the creativity of some of the later games and exercises that it presented, which I felt could be of value even to people who are already quite comfortable and experienced with sexual talk. For the "solo" exercises you need to find a place where you can be alone and know you can speak loudly without being heard by anyone; it is also recommended you keep a private notebook for the exercises, some of which ask you to write things down.

Exercises : Touch and Tell

Lie down in bed, get very comfortable, and begin a genital caress. As you touch yourself, say whatever comes to your mind. Let it come out in a stream of consciousness. Try not to censor anything. Your stream might include moans, grunts, words, sentence fragments, random thoughts, descriptions of your body, descriptions of what you are doing, descriptions of what you are feeling, or descriptions of fantasies that are being triggered by your caresses. Caress yourself for at least fifteen minutes, and try to keep talking the entire time, even if the only thing that comes out of your mouth is gobbledy-gook. It doesn't matter if you are being silly, serious, outrageous, or incomprehensible. You don't need to make a single bit of sense. All you need to do is let yourself go....

Exercises : Expletive Not Deleted

Open your notebook to a fresh page and get ready for a little more brainstorming. What I want you to do is write down as many sexy verbs as you can think of, placing an asterisk next to the ones that turn you on the most.

I'll help you get started. Try these:

 kiss, lick, nibble, tease, screw,

 bite, touch, suck, play, eat,

 chew, push, pull, brush, taste,

 rub, grind, stick, jam, blow,

 squeeze, fondle, smell, caress,

 grab, hump, swallow, spank, drink, thrust

Get the idea? Now it's your turn. If you're starting to blush, remember that all of these words can be found in the Scrabble Word Dictionary. Hopefully, you'll also think of a few that can't be.

Once you have completed your list I want you to practice saying these verbs out loud. Start with the first word on the list, kiss. Mouth the word silently a few times. Then try saying it in the lowest of whispers. Gradually build from there. Experiment with all different kinds of affect too. Once you have comfortably reached a stage whisper, move on to the next verb on your list and begin again. Proceed in this fashion through your entire list, paying special attention to the ones you've marked with an asterisk.

Exercises : Wet and Nasty

Turn to a fresh page in your notebook. This time, I want you to write down as many sexy adjectives as you can think of, placing an asterisk next to the ones that turn you on the most. Once again, I'll help you get started:

 hard, big, soft, wet,

 hot, lovely, aching, gorgeous,

 sweet, slippery, greedy, magnificent,

Pg 110





 tasty, tasty, juicy, round, firm,

 wild, luscious, erect, tight, huge,

 naked, steamy, bare, throbbing, strong,

 swollen, stiff, gentle, raging, hungry

Don't be embarrassed. You'll see at least one or two of these words every week in your newspaper's crossword puzzle.

After you have completed your list I want you to practice saying these adjectives out loud. Start with the first one on your list: hard. Mouth it silently a few times. Now say it over and over again in the lowest of whispers.

Gradually build from there until you have comfortably reached a stage whisper. Proceed in this fashion through every sexy adjective on your list, paying special attention to your favourites.

Peoples' voices naturally lower when they get aroused, so if you intentionally drop your voice (i.e. make it huskier) it will seem more erotic.

Read some of what you wrote above in a huskier voice.

Read some of what you wrote above aloud, gradually increasing the volume and intensity from a whisper until you're screaming: Cry out. Imagine you're so full of passion you're climbing the walls. Hold nothing back.

Exercises : Sweet Nothings

This exercise begins with your partner lying in bed, face down. You should be sitting, or lying on your side, very close to him/her... Think about all of those sexy words and sentences you've been aching to say to this man/woman. If you need to refresh your memory, check your notebook before you start the exercise. Choose [a Pg 111





word] ... then lean over and whisper it in his ear. Proceed in this fashion through at least a dozen words. Now try some ... sentences from [Incomplete Sentences 1 & 2].

There is one very important requirement for this exercise: Your partner must remain silent and passive the entire time. Even if he/she thinks he/she is being helpful, unwelcome feedback can disrupt the mood and make you clam up in a hurry. Your partner needs to stay quiet, and stay still, lying face-down on the bed.

Exercises : Doctor Doctor

Your assignment is to study the various parts of her body, describe them in the sexiest language you can muster, and talk freely about how each part turns you on.... He might want to say, for example, "Your neck is so smooth and so soft I want to kiss and bite it...." Now remove your partner’s blouse so that you can study, fully appreciate, and talk to her about her shoulders, her back, her arms, and her hands.... Proceeding slowly and intently, you should study her buttocks, hips, thighs, and calves, talking oh so sexy as you go. Next come her ankles, then the soles of her feet, and finally her toes.

After fifteen minutes, turn her over and lie comfortably on her back. Starting with her face - her eyes, nose, mouth, chin - you should spend the next fifteen minutes slowly working your way down her entire body until you have reached her toes. You should always try to make your descriptions as sexy as possible, letting you know how truly exciting each part of her body is. You might want to say things such as: "Your thighs are so soft they make me hard" or "Every time I look at your nipples I want to put them in my mouth."

Remember: She’s not supposed to do anything, just listen, and he's not supposed to do anything but talk. Don't break the rules!

The fact is that most people love to hear their partner make noise during sex regardless of whether or not they're making sense (or sometimes most of all when they're not making sense).

As another aside, I think it would have been interesting to include an exercise where you are supposed to pleasure your partner to orgasm, but must stop whatever you are doing immediately if he or she stops talking or making noise; I personally have found this to be a very effective way for a couple to get past self-consciousness as regards vocalizing during sex. Anyway, after you've finished the next few exercises you might try it and see if you agree with me...

In these next three exercises one partner plays the "passive" role. When you are the passive partner, your job is simply to do whatever your partner asks, providing it is not something that you find unpleasant; the passive partner always has the option of saying 'I don't want to do that right now.' You do not need to explain or justify this decision. If you want to discuss it after the exercise is over, that's fine, but during the exercise the active partner must accept your decision, and move on to another request.

Exercises : Come and Get It

This exercise begins the moment you and your partner enter the bedroom (or whatever room you choose for the exercise). For the first twenty to thirty minutes, you will play the active role and your partner will play the passive role.

As the active partner, you will start by making your first request. You can ask for anything you can think of, but you need to be very specific. For example, you might start by saying: "Please light some candles" or "Please take off everything but your underwear" or "Please take off my underwear and suck my cock." Nothing can happen until you ask for it. Your partner can refuse your request, but all of the choices are yours.... It helps a great deal to stop and think for a moment before you make any request; think about what it is you want at this very moment... Think about your needs - she'll get his chance soon enough....

Pg 112





If your partner accepts your request, but she is not doing exactly what you want, give her gentle, but straightforward directions until she gets it right. If it's something about the way he's touching you or not touching you, for example, guide her hands or demonstrate with your own hands. After twenty or thirty minutes, switch roles...

Exercises : Provocative statements

This exercise is like Come and Get It, with an added fun twist: "The passive partner also has the right to respond verbally with provocative statements such as 'Ask me again,' ‘I didn't hear you,' 'Say it louder,' ‘Say please,' or’ Beg me.' This erotic taunting must always be done in a way that is playful and loving; it must never be done in a way that is demeaning or full of ridicule. In addition, the passive partner can only play with the active partner's request if he or she has every intention of ultimately responding to that request."

Exercises : A hot way to have sex

Basically, this exercise is like Come and Get It, except that:

This time, once you have made a request of your partner and she tarts to comply, it is your job to fill her ears with as much sexy feedback as possible. You want to do this in a stream of consciousness fashion, trying very hard not to censor yourself. Your goal is to give her a blow-by-blow description in the sexiest way possible, of how everything she is doing is making you feel. You can do this with dialogue, sounds, or a combination of the two. Just let it out. And don't stop! After twenty to thirty minutes, switch roles and give your partner a chance to talk really sexy to you.

For a variation on this, try incorporating the playful taunting technique you learned in Provocative statements.

If you are playing the active role, let your partner know how this is making you feel (For example: "You're making me crazy ... I have to get inside of you now!");

Regards making sighs, moans, screams, etc. during sex

I firmly believe that making noise does more than just enhance orgasm; I believe that making noise is actually necessary to have a full orgasm. I don't care if it's grunts, cries, shouts, words, sentences, or full paragraphs...if you're not making noise, you are preventing your body from releasing energy and holding back the power of your own orgasm.

Fantasy Talk and RolePlaying

Expands on the erotic communication skills to create sexy little scenarios and stories. The key idea is that these can be built around your partner's fantasies, and you share your fantasies. To do this, the key idea is to share your fantasies in such a way that you both feel emotionally safe in doing so; if someone is afraid of judgment or blame for a fantasy they happen to share, they're unlikely to share much of anything.

List of the 20 most common sexual fantasies:

 Having sex in a public place

 Having sex with more than one or a multitude of partners

 Having sex in a place in which there is a risk of getting caught

 Having sex out in nature or some other appealing setting

 Being sexually taken, possessed or dominated

 Being in complete sexual control of a partner

 Having sex with a prostitute

 Being a prostitute or a person who is sexually uninhibited

 Having sex with a virgin

 Being a virgin or a sexually inexperienced person

 Having sex with a priest, nun, or some other forbidden or inappropriate partner Pg 113





 Pretending to be a celebrity or fictional character

 Having sex with a celebrity or fictional character

 Having sex that includes a focus on specific articles of clothing, food, or a part of the body not usually associated with lovemaking

 Trying out sexual approaches or positions that you may not actually be practicing in real life

 Having sex with an animal

 Cross-dressing, that is, having a fantasy in which you either willingly wear the clothing of the opposite sex, or are forced to do so

 Gender reversal, which is, imagining that you are a member of the opposite sex

 Having sex with a member of your own sex. (Note: Many confirmed heterosexuals occasionally have homosexual fantasies, even if they have no wish to act on them in real life)

 Having sex with a deity or a spiritual leader

At this point each partner has their own stack of 20 cards, each with one of these fantasies written on it. Now each person sorts all their cards into four separate piles:

 Fantasies that Turn Me On and That I'm Willing to Share with My Lover

 Fantasies that Turn Me On but That I'm Resistant to Sharing with My Lover

 Fantasies that Leave Me in Neutral

 Fantasies that Turn Me Off

Obviously, fantasies never have to be acted upon. What you're doing in this exercise is learning more about some little images and vignettes that your partner finds erotic, which may not have anything to do with real-life desires; this exercise isn't really about your relationship per se unless you both discover that you share fantasies in common AND decide that you want to act on them together.

Three helpful principles for keeping your erotic spark alive:

 Express your thanks and appreciation for all the pleasure your partner has given you.

 Build a provocative mood of positive expectation or even delicious suspense as to what your future sexual encounter will hold.

 Continue to remind your lover of the special sexual connection you have even when you're not together

– via mail, telephone, telegraph, tape, video, e-mail, carrier pigeon, or whatever other method you may devise.

Here are some of the specific suggestions to help lovers with these principles: Words of Satisfaction and Appreciation

The period right after orgasm is a very special time, when "genuine words of love and appreciation can be most easily absorbed and assimilated." Bonnie suggests that you take this time to say a little something appreciative and loving to your partner, even something as simple as "Mmmmm, that was wonderful" or "I'm so lucky to have you as a lover."

Previews of Coming Attractions

This idea is to build anticipation for your next encounter by tantalizing your partner with some of the details of what you would like to do with him or her. This is especially fun if you use sensual and erotic language, hint at a surprise or two, and let your voice express your passion for your partner. Many people in long-term relationships "have overcome sagging sexual interest and recaptured the thrill of their early courtship by adding this dimension to their lovemaking." These "previews" can be made even more fun if you give them while touching or teasing your partner, or perhaps while brushing his or her hair or taking a bath or shower together. I clearly like the bath idea:

Pg 114





For instance, as you soap up your partner's breasts, you might say: "Hmmmm, what can I do with these the next time to make them feel even more wonderful?" Or, she’s washing your cock, she might ask: "When we're in bed next time, would you like me to begin with long, slow strokes like this ... or light, circular caresses like this?"

Take-Out Fantasies

The idea here is to tell your lover a specific little fantasy which has to do with something specific (and ordinary) that will happen to him or her during that day.

Example:

"When you're at your staff meeting this afternoon, I want you to imagine that I am hiding under the table. And while your boss is expounding about the new marketing plan for your company, I'll be silently take off your underwear and softly and gently start licking your pussy.”

A twist on this is to require that the receiving partner report back at the end of the day on the effect the suggestion had; this report could be another fantasy that the first one inspired, for example.

Phone sex with your lover

A phone sex with your lover can serve as a vehicle to keep your romantic feelings alive, to enhance intimacy, to build erotic anticipation, and to fuel your sexual fantasies. In these conversations, you can also include messages of erotic communication that rekindle the spiritual connection you have with your lover. For lovers who can't see each other every day, it might be fun to connect by phone every night just before bedtime for conversation, erotic talk, and possibly an erotic dream suggestion.

It's helpful to combine explicit, sexy descriptions with words of tenderness and suggestions of relaxation; such calming, reassuring words are particularly important when giving dream suggestions over the phone because your partner does not have the benefit of your physical presence and soothing touch.

It's also comforting and reassuring if you personalize your words, including things that are specific to your partner and not just elements of sex in general.

It's helpful to put yourself in a romantic and sexy mood before you even call; hot, soothing baths work particularly well (especially if you illuminate the bathroom by candlelight and play some "soft, sensual" music) as does thinking back on your last encounter with your partner (which is also a good starting point for the erotic part of this night's conversation with your partner).

If you plan on leaving erotic voice messages for your lover, it's obviously best that you do so on a private voice mail system that only your lover has access to. If your messages must be left on an answering machine (or if he or she sometimes listens to voice mail messages on speakerphone), then it might be a good idea to preface your erotic messages with, "The following message is personal and confidential" or "The message you are about to hear is for your ears only." The idea is to give him or her a chance to stop the message if others are in the room.

In any case, erotic voice mail messages can be a fun, spontaneous, and particularly easy way to stay connected (they're one of my personal favourites).

The Telephone Striptease

This builds on the previous section about phone sex with your lover, by describing how to strip and tease and have sex with each other (in fantasy) during a telephone call with each other.

If you're going to be doing a lot of phone sex with your lover, having speaker phones or headsets (so both your hands are free when you're on the phone) might be helpful. If you find yourself becoming too aroused to continue talking, express your growing excitement through your breathing, sighing, and other passionate Pg 115





sounds. Remember, your voice is the only line of connection with your lover here, and you want to keep that line flowing with sexual energy.

Keeping the Spark Alive at a Distance

The classic way to do this is to write each other sexy, romantic, or comforting letters.

Sexy, romantic, or comforting audiotapes for your lover can sometimes be even more powerful. If you and your lover are regularly apart from each other for long periods of time, it might work for you to each carry a mini-cassette recorder with You for recording spontaneous messages to each other (mailing the tape to your lover at the end of the week or the month, of course).

Guide To Role Play And Dirty Talking

USER : TrueStory

Kelly_Monaco and I have been working on this guide for some time. This is going to be a bigger more expanded guide later on, but this is what we have so far. I know THIS IS LONG, but this is good shit! A lot of theory in the beginning but it's VERY important to understand. We highly recommend reading "On Dominance" post first, as prerequisite to this. It’s something we have enjoyed writing and talking about, and we hope you will enjoy reading it.

Present:

Guide to Roleplay, Dirty talking and Kinky shit!

What we discuss here are the basics on how to get started with dirty talk.

This post will cover:

 Introduction to dirty talk

 Correct frame and attitude for dirty talk

 A note on safety

 Setting the scene

 Introduction to fantasy

 ‘Mild’ dirty talk suggestions

 Introduction to online dirty talk

Keep in mind dirty talk has limitless possibilities. Inspiration can come from anywhere: talking to people, reading books, movies etc.

I've seen many women complaining about lack of dominance their men have in bed. Usually those types of conversations with women turn into discussion of ‘dirty talking’ and lack of it. There are many guys inquiring how to get their girlfriend to talk dirty, so I figured I'll write a guide. I've pushed sex-play to pretty high limits.

Everything described in this guide, I've done myself with various girls; some more than others.

Because, some of the aspects of dirty talk can sound degrading to women, I wanted to point out that it is NOT

degrading. And explain how it really works. Here you go:

Separate TWO different realities

On reality is behind the closed doors of your bedroom.

Pg 116

This is play fantasy land you two can live in. What happens there does not carry out in real life. It is very important to show your woman that you accept her as a person and respect her outside of this reality. A lot of things, you’re going to be doing, will demonstrate playful disrespect, even disgrace, but it ends in PRETEND

WORLD. In other words, this is fantasy, and nothing you two do together leaves the fantasy world. It’s also unspoken rule to keep it a secret between parties involved (sometimes there are more than two ) Second reality is normal life. Shit that goes on day to day.

This is how you treat her on daily basis. Things you can do in the bedroom might not be socially or legally acceptable in real life. Like playful slapping is fun during kinky sex, but completely unacceptable in real life.

Also, you may slip in and out of “fantasy reality” during normal daily activities, but keep it discreet from others.

You two will have a subtle communication, where she will understand all the “inside” references and talks without revealing it to outside world. If she winks at you “meet me in the bathroom”, this means she wants to suck you off. But nobody needs to know that but you two.

Behind closed doors, you two are free to play as you wish. Everything you do when being intimate

***STAYS*** between you two. You don't tell your buddies about it. You don't tell friends about it. You don't write about it, and you probably should NOT blog about it either. Just a thought.

Also keep in mind

Rape is very serious criminal charge. So, play within comfortable limits; some sex play can be qualified as sexual and domestic abuse. Naturally, women will tell you when it’s too far. And you will be VERY surprised how far you can push things. In roleplay and dirty talk the words "NO" and "please stop" have completely different meaning. I will explain how to keep roleplay and dirty talking safe.

Communication is probably the most important aspect of dirty talking. There should be no misunderstanding.

Majority of your communication will happen on subtle level, through body language and eye contact.

Pain is a very tricky thing. Often in the heat of the moment you may do things to her that would normally cause serious pain. Often, if you get carried away, you might do some minor to serious damage to her skin.

(Scratching, slapping, biting, sucking, hickeys, etc) You MUST consider her reputation. If she has a professional job, giving her hickeys is not the right thing to do. Also, when slapping a girl in play, MAKE

SURE you do not leave bruises. (Happened to me; had very rough sex, and the next day her friends were asking us if there was is abuse in our relationship)

Use discretion: She is a bunny outside and tiger in bed. In front of her friends and at work nobody must know about the dirty things she does to please you

ATTITUDE to adopt for dirty talk:

Focus on your basics: You must make her feel safe, she must trust you, and you must be dominant. Pretty strict set of rules, I cannot emphasis the “she must trust you” part. This will break or make your sex life.

TALK about sex. People don’t talk about it. You should make talking about sex a normal part of your life with your girlfriend or wife. I mean what else is there to talk about? : Some important concepts:

You are doing this for her pleasure.

Pg 117

She must be enjoying herself, for you to enjoy yourself. Good sex happens when two people are only concerned about each other’s pleasure. You should focus on her pleasure first, because, she can cum and she can cum many times. If you are roleplaying it might help her have more intense orgasm or multiple orgasms.

If she raises any concern about dominance/submission or about what you are doing don’t get into a huge discussion. Just listen to what she says, say you are glad she trusts you enough to tell you how she feels, and start slowly from the beginning.

If she is inexperienced, do not show concern. Some girls haven’t been exposed to dirty talk before. It doesn’t mean that she does not want to do it, it just means that you will have to lead more, and it will take some time for her to catch on and participate more.

Tell her all you want is her to be willing to try new things. Always compliment her, never criticize, and never let her feel any pressure to say/do anything. You are dominant in bed and lead her, if you want to fuck her doggy style, flip her that way, if you want to fuck her against a wall, push her against the wall and spread her legs.

She needs to let go to orgasm so she must leave the thinking to you, and only focus on how she is feeling.

Be open minded and she will follow your frame. Eliminate any limiting beliefs or judgmental attitude you may have towards sex. Such attitudes include negative connotation of words “slut”, “bitch”, “whore”, etc. Those are play words now. They only mean good thing. If you cannot wrap this around your head, try rethinking why you despise women so much.

Encourage and embrace your woman’s sexuality. Keep in mind that women are not that different from men, they also love sex. Don’t be threatened or intimidated by female sexuality. If you can unlock her potential to be sexual and sensual with you, she will exhaust you.

Assume that she is always wet for you, purring for you and ready to have your dick deep inside of her.

Look around yourself, and think of places you can have sexual interaction with your girl: anything from making out, to blow job, to discrete fingering, or bathroom quickie. Think of world as your sex playground. Get creative.

Sex is not routine habit. It's a spontaneous event. Don't make it a "Friday night thing" or "before falling asleep".

Have sex whenever, wherever, and as often ad you want. Don't mundane it.

Try to feel turned on all the time. When you feel turned on and sexual, you, as a man, will develop hormones which will produce subtle smell. Your girl will pick up on that smell. There is a hard science behind it. When you’re turned on, you do everything with “sexy touch”.

SAFETY:

This is very important. The reason why the majority of girls do not want to indulge in kinky and rough sex is because they don't feel "safe" with the guy. TRUST IS IMPORTANT.

Try not to force things, and do not try to change your girl. If you want to do something with her, bring it up to her, but if she says “no” leave at that. Once you get her to open up and trust you, she will do that “forbidden”

thing after all. I have had many girls who never would consider doing anal or ass-to-mouth. Within couple months of sex, it was one of their favourite thing to do.

Pg 118

Have a safety word and gesture or motion. If her mouth is gagged she may not be able to say the word, so have a gesture she can use, or she can repeatedly hum something. If her mouth is shut, periodically open it and ask her "if she likes being fucked", give her chance to say safety word if she doesn't.

Keep in mind most people err on the safe side so you will almost never have to use any of those. But it’s nice to agree on it.

Now.

"How do we get her to do all this kinky stuff with me?"

This is something you can casually bring up with her, but NOT in the same evening you want to do it. Maybe sometime when you two are talking about sex, you should say "we should try roleplaying sometime" AND

LEAVE IT AT THAT!

When you're having sex or about to you can lead in with: "baby I think it's hot when you talk to me in bed" and

"i want you to be my naughty little girl" if she's receptive of idea, try switching to "you're my dirty little slut.

My slut and nobody else's"

This works best when you whisper it in her ear when you're being sexual.

Try to touch her more often when you two are alone or nobody can see it. Slap her ass, or spontaneously reach around her from the back, lean into her ear and whisper "I am soooo turned on by you right now, I could just rip your clothes off and fuck you right here on the floor... can you feel how hard I am?!"

Women LOVE when you compliment them. But they want to feel sexy about it. Randomly come up to her, when nobody is around, slap her ass and say "those jeans make your ass look soo hot, I want to spank it over and over again! you're so damn sexy!"

Initial reaction could be anything from "Ummm oookey.." to "oh my!"

If she's not receptive of your advances and talks, she's a prude. It will take some time to break it in. You may be diving into it too fast and it caught her off guard.

But if you express interest in dirty talking, she will do her own homework.

First you need to start slow. Get her to try something stereotypically slutty. Then comment how hot and sexy she looks. Tell her she looks like a naughty student/school girl/french maid/etc. She will probably giggle. Then call her over: "come over here... have you been naughty today?"

8 out of 10 girls will play along. "yes/no" ...."well then we have a problem here... what have you been naughty about?"

If you're reading this and wondering..."ummm this is not gonna work...not with my girl.... " Then you are not dominant in the relationship and you haven't worked on your manhood and leadership. The rest of this guide may not be as useful for you until you address those issues on self confidence.

So onto the rest of this...THE FIRST roleplay experience is critical but must be easy going. If you open the pandora's box , and she gets into it, the sky is the limit.

Let's continue,

She will say something like "umm I don't know hahaha he he he" - don't buy into her 'he he's'

Pg 119

"I think you need to get spanking" and push her next to you on the bed but make sure she falls over your knee.

Slap her ass several time and repeat something along these lines: "Bad girls get spanked. Bad girls get in trouble. Are you a bad girl?"

-“ no I am a good girl...”

(Keep in mind, you want to ask questions that do not involve her making any decisions. "Do you want to be spanked?" may be a good rhetorical questions, to follow up with "Yes you do" without giving her chance to answer. But if you just ask that and wait for her to "allow" you to do it, you will break the mood. NEVER ask her permission to do anything to her, but do indeed tell her what you're about to do. "I am going to make you be a bad girl..get on your knees!" but never "can you please get on your knees" **ALWAYS TELL DO NOT

ASK*** for her to do things. Women like demanding and commanding men in bed)

"Have you been bad? Have you acted like a little slut lately??" - BELIEVE YOUR OWN FANTASY.

"nooo...."

"I don't believe you ..." then reach under her skirt up her leg "well good girls don't let men touch them like this"

At this point she should be turned on

"I don't believe you've gotten your punishment....maybe you should keep quiet" and gently put your free hand's middle finger on her lips ...she will naturally put it in her mouth and suck on it.

Women are sooo receptive of play. You will be blown away how much she will get into this.

"god you are such a naughty girl... you are probably going to get in trouble with your parents...do they know you do naughty things in school??"

-ummm hmmm

"we need to address this..." pull her panties off "this is very very inappropriate, missy"

-ohh.. what are you doing.... ahh

"I am seeing how naughty you are... .maybe.... I won't tell anyone...maybe if you could win me over" ..now push her between your legs so she's on her knees and you're sitting on the edge of the bed Pull out the dick...."redeem your bad behaviour..you naughty girl"

Mood is set.

Important thing to keep in mind: do not interrupt the flow. If you’re talking dirty do not switch over to “normal”

talk. This will break the mood. If you’re calling her naughty girl, or if you’re forcing her down, don’t pause and say “you ok?”. If she says “ouch..you’re hurting me” you’re doing something wrong... lean over and say

“shhh!!!” and French kiss her... “all better”....continue making out until she’s into it.. then resume “now where were we?”

FANTASY:

If you have NOT read Nancy Friday's "My Secret Garden"; immediately purchase that book. If anything will help you understand how girls work, that book will be the one.

In essence:

Pg 120

The majority of girls want to be dominated. They want a man (or men) to control them in bed. It's a subprimal instinct. Don't argue with this. So knowing what you're doing is VERY important.

Society programmed girls to be good. She’s not slutty nor she’s a whore. So anything crazy you want to do, you have to initiate. Otherwise, if she was to initiate kinky sex, she’d come off as slut. Which is bad. But if you started it, then it’s “not her fault”. Most of the time they would quietly let you fuck them missionary while craving to be pounded doggy style in the ass. Why? Because, "She's not that kind of girl" but if she initiates the act she might come off as one...if of course, you're not ok with it. (fear of sexual rejection) But if you do it, "it's not her fault" and it also opens up her mind that you're OK with all those stuff.

Good analogy of women wanting rough good sex. It's like asking your parents for a large sum of money. You really don't want to do it, you try to avoid it, and you try to figure out your own way before you have to come down to that. If you do, you will never hear the end of “how immature and not independent you are”. However, if your dad calls you and says "Son, I am giving you $10,000 just because", especially, when you need it would you feel excited?!

In the everyday world, women face a lot of challenges and frustrations. However, when they get back to their boyfriends, in the evening, they want to let that frustration out. And nothing let’s frustration out like a good fucking. They don't want to do any work, they just want to live in a orgasmic fantasy land for several minutes (or hours).

Women have VERY vivid imagination. Unlike men, they want to feel stimulated on many aspects: emotionally, physically, intellectually, and physiologically.

Emotionally: she wants to feel connected and close to you. Not the sappy "baby we are one" connection, but a connection where her mind feels a rush of feelings she cannot describe, usually towards you. I think Braddock wrote a good post explaining “love” and chemicals. This is it.

Physically: no brainer, but she wants to feel body touching, her nipples played with, her clit massaged, her stomach kissed, her neck bitten, her hair pulled, her ass slapped and fingered, her pussy deeply penetrated, her arms held (up and behind her head), your body on hers, etc. The more stimulation at once the more excited she will be. That’s why some women LOVE nipple clamps and other “toys”

Intellectually: she wants to imagine things when she's getting fucked. She wants to engage her creativity and pretend you two are fucking on the Eiffel Tower, or in the woods, or on the roof of the building, she might even pretend Johnny Depp is fucking her, or she might want to fantasize that she's a hooker and getting banged in the alley. I am being serious. Read Nancy Friday’s book. Some girl may have fantasies about getting fucked by entire Miami Dolphins football team in the locker room. It’s just a fantasy, so chill.

I had a girl that pretended she was my mistress and I was cheating on my wife with her (I am not married).

Some of the "fantasies" are out there, but it's ONLY PRETEND, ok!?

Physiologically: she wants to smell you. She wants to hear you whisper in her ear. She wants you to talk to her.

She wants to feel her hormones drive her crazy. She wants to feel her orgasm.

All of those feelings are her biology.

Men have those feelings too. But, we, mostly, focus on physical and sometimes intellectual ones. Because we fantasize about shit and we like when that shit touches us. Rarely we think of emotional connection nor do we smell her or like her talking to us. At least we haven't discovered that those stimulations exist.

Pg 121

Let's play out some common fantasies most women find arousing.

School girl and teacher

- cliche, but fun to play. Good for beginners.

French maid / cleaning girl

- another cliche but again fun to play out. You can even tell your girlfriend "baby, I want you to clean around the house topless with no panties on in a skirt... and you might need to clean something else too afterwards " be playful but sound serious.

Some good lines to use during or after or before:

"you look so hot when you bend over"

"why don't you come over here....I want you to pick this up" drop something

"good girl...that's right...bend down ... right here..between my knees..I think you deserve a break from cleaning...and a little reward"

While she's cleaning, come from behind her, and violate her by finger her pussy and ass (if you're on that level).

Stranger in the house

- this is good for couples that have been experimenting with roleplay and want something new. Tell her to get naked and blind fold herself and leave the door open (right before you arrive). Walk into the door and head straight to the bedroom. If she starts talking "shhh" her gently...do not say a word. "Anonymity" is the kick of this fantasy. Slowly caress her as you undress yourself. (Just unzip your pants and pull them down). ...get her wet and bothered. Keep shushing her so she doesn't talk. Girls like control. Remember, it's play only. Start fucking her... (this can escalate into something else). Make her cum. Cum all over her and leave the room. Go to the other room or something.

Strip tease / lap dance

- Self explanatory. But you may need to tell her what you want. Sometimes it works best after you bought her something nice, like flowers. Say “now baby, I want you to do something for me.... I want you to striptease dance” plan an evening for it, bring wine/champagne and put down good music.

Stock lines:

"you look so hot when you swing your hips like this"

"why don't you come over her and show me this juicy pussy of yours"

"bend over....and shake it for me... I love it..."

"do I get a private lap dance?"

This fantasy is good for fun, that will naturally lead into sex... but you can put a spin in it with "you're not supposed to be doing this with your customers...don't you?"

and "what happens in the champagne room? " take her hand and lead her to the bedroom.

Prostitute / Hooker

- not something for new guys. But she wants to walk down the street, and you pick her up, take her to a motel and fuck her on the bed. You really have to use your imagination on this one. And something you should discuss with her. Don't tell her to be your hooker. Say "I think it would be soo fucking hot if we pretended that you're a high class prostitute and I was your client" Some girls might not like this fantasy, some would love it. If she's into this, play the part, do the role:

-What such a good lookingg girl doing walking all by herself tonight?

-Do you randomly get into strangers cars like this? (finger her pussy)

-I know just the place. (this fantasy is amplified 100folds if it's in cheap motel) (she can also give you blow job in the parking lot)

Pg 122

Virgin

- some girls like to pretend they are virgins. You can teach her how to please you. You REALLY have to know what you're doing, because she will pretend she doesn't. You can ask her sometime during normal conversation:

"I like how we play ..I like pretending with you...when we do things to each other. I want to teach you how to please me...and you will be my virgin student. you will be innocent and wear what I will tell you...and I will show you how I like you on me"

-You are such a good student

-You're doing so well... take that cock in...stretch that virgin pussy/asshole/mouth

-Your pussy is dripping like you never had cock before...I cannot wait to break you in

-You look so innocent with your legs spread for me

let me help you with that.... you're a good girl aren't you? never had a dick in your mouth??

- Do your friends/parents know you're having sex with strange boys?

- You can't take that dick inside of you yet....you're too tight...your pussy needs to be stretched

- your moaning is soo hot, you are soo innocent and yet you're so sexy..i love stretching your tight hole.. you squeeze my cock good

Slave (sex slave)

- this is for more hardcore guys. You can tie her up and put a leash on her. She will act like your sex slave. She's there for your pleasure. She will do anything you want her to. THIS IS for certain types of girls and certain types of relationships. DO NOT try to go from vanilla sex to this shit. You will "freak her out".

-"You will be my little toy girl cunt tonight"

-I will fuck you as I please when I please, you are here to serve me, do you understand?

- spread your legs like a good slut, let me look at your pussy

- good girl, now come here and suck this cock

- Choke on it and slobber all over it like it's the last cock you suck

- You like getting fucked in your mouth don't you, you little broad?

- Bend your ass over this couch...that's good..now spread your ass cheeks and take this dick like a slut you are.

good sex slave...please me with your tight ass/pussy

- you're here for my pleasure, only for my pleasure, I don't give a shit if you cum. I am using you to get off

- you want your mouth covered in my hot cum? like a good cum slut?

- swallow this ..everything until you choke...don't let a single drop out. understand?

Rape and Struggle fantasy

-be careful with this one, and it's best to discuss with the girl sometimes before you do it. Then don't try to do it for a week. But make sure there are no bad memories. I would be VERY careful with this one. MAKE sure she has nothing bad happened to her in childhood or in life that may trigger déjà vue. Again some dirty lines to use:

"shut up you little cunt, you're getting fuck whether you want it or not"

- you are too tight, but I don't care, I will force myself in...you like that huh?

- you take it all, good girl good girl..now shut your slutty mouth and take it...get fucked...good girl... you deserve this dick inside of you

- oh what is that, hurts? this will hurt even more"

You can be pretty rough in this fantasy, of course, if she likes it. It would be even hotter if she could try to escape, struggle or run away. Some girls enjoy being gagged with duct tape or something wrapped around their mouth. maybe tie her to a bed post or tie her hands together....

Ripping her clothes off or apart magnifies this fantasy 100folds. But make sure it's nothing nice. Also getting her partially naked is better than undressing her. Pulling her pants down and keeping shirt on really plays on the fantasy. Also "raping" her on the stairs or in unusual places is more exciting.

BUT REMEMBER: rape is a crime. If she wants you to stop (SAFE WORD) stop.

- ANYTHING with blind fold and cuffs - again, this falls into the more serious category of play, but do not go for this right away. Introduce sex play one thing at a time.

Pg 123

blind fold is actually fun. In threesomes, or in group sex. But it can be used in regular sex. Often you can combine blind fold with other toys, like dildo, nipple clamp, vibrator, butt plug. etc.

There are a couple rules for guys.

Create a story. Once I dated a freaky girl and at some point in the relationships most of our sex was in form of some theatrical roleplay. . Almost every time I had sex with my girlfriends we had some kind of sexy story behind it. So if you want her to get fucked bent over the couch, create a story how she's a naughty maid and she didn't clean the dish’s after dinner and now she needs to be punished.

TALK ABOUT THOSE THINGS not when you're about to have sex. Do it during normal conversations about

"us" (you two).

ALWAYS use "It would be soo hot if…" - remember all this shit is pretend. You play with her. You do not bring this into real life. But you talk about it during real life, when something triggers discussion, and you FRAME IT as play and only play.

BALANCE HOW YOU TREAT HER - do not just have disgraceful sex with her all the time. It's addictive, I know. But sometimes "make love to her" ...show her that it's ONLY play and you really appreciate her as a woman and as a person. Reassurance that you can return to ‘normal’ state after kinky sex will make her feel comfortable to engage in more kinky play. If she’s staying at your place, wake her up the next morning with you gently massaging her lower back, legs etc, in a sensual, but non-sexual way. Keep in mind you HAVE to appreciate her feminine side. Buy her flowers occasionally, show her how much you adore her, cook for her, or make her feel cared for. She will open up even faster to you.

FEEDBACK IS EVERYTHING - I ALWAYS talk to her several hours after we both cum (if we have energy) I always say "oh my god baby you were sooo hot when you did ____ and I almost came when you did ____"

ALWAYS give positive feedback. NEVER criticize. She will tell you things she likes. This will guide you what kind of girl she is.

If she doesn't feel comfortable with what you're doing, step back. Move in slowly. If she feels awkward pretending to be a "naughty french maid” then she's probably self conscious. Take her out dancing, for few drinks, after, she will have an easier time letting go and talking naughty.

Literotica - 100% free sex stories, erotic audio, adult fiction with wifeslut, bdsm, etc! is a good resource for ideas: they have a bunch of free stories. READ them. I know, I know, boring shit, but most are (ones written by women) a good indication of what women find hot. You would be surprised. It’s often NOT what guys typically find arousing or think would be arousing to a woman.

NEVER tell her or your friends about this shit EVER!

Dirty Talk

INTRO

I did most of the introduction already, but here is how to get started.

ALWAYS start small

You always have to go first and start by talking to her during sex.

If you don't know what to say, start by commenting on what you're going to do to her.

Pg 124

"I am going to kiss you slow...start with your neck...go down your chest, to your tits... to your nipples...lick them a little bit" (do as you say)

"I am going to suck on your nipple, then lick it and bite it. You look sooo hot laying down here like this"

Or if you're during the act, make comments on what you are enjoying:

"I love fucking you like this...you look soo hot when your tits bounce up and down"

(NOTE: do not use "boobies" or "kitty" or "butt" or anything cute in bed. Repeat these words after me: she has a pussy, not a vagina, and she has tits, her nipples are hard when she sees your big dick. Her asshole is tight for your long cock. Her mouth is there to suck your shaft and your head. Her tongue will lick your balls.

No penises. No vaginas. No anus. Those words are NOT sexy or dominant Also do not be afraid to use the words: slut, whore, broad, cunt but IN THE RIGHT CONTEXT. I WILL

EXPLAIN

Also tell her "your lips are so sexy, they will look so hot around my hard dick."

Some other words to use:

"You look so naughty and sexy on your knees. Your mouth works soo good up and down my dick"

"When you get fucked liked this, you are soo hot...you make me wanna cum"

ASK HER questions

"Do you like to get fucked by me?"

She will be forced to talk.

"When I fuck your tight pussy how does it feel...?"

she might be apprehensive to talk at first, but keep fucking her, she will talk.

"when you're on top of me like this...I want you to tell me how much you want my dick deep inside of your tight little pussy?”

WHISPER:

Lean in and whisper in her ear: "when I am soo close to you and I am soo deep inside of you, I want to fill your pussy up with my hot cum...would you like that?" (even though you don't or won't and SHOULD NOT, it's OK

to pretend)

"your pussy wraps my cock so tight, your legs feel so good around my body, my breathing down your neck gives you chills, my wet tongue licking your ear..." gently lick her ear and blow at it (not in it) "you look soo hot under me.."

When you're fucking her doggy style grab her hair close to the roots and gently pull her head towards you and lean in towards her ear and whisper "When you're getting pounded doggy style I keep looking at how sexy you look, it makes me want to go deeper and deeper into your tight pussy...feel up on your tits (grab her tits) and push myself even further into you"

Those few innocent talks should get you warmed up.

Pg 125

Here are some hardcore lines to use. Keep in mind if you are doing rough sex, keep the sex talk rough. If you're doing play sex, keep sex talk play. Mix-matching both will create confusion. If you're fucking her like a dirty sex slave, calling her "honey bunny" or "baby sweets" or "little angel" isn't really appropriate.

But if you're doing virgin girl role play, or "innocent student willing to do anything for a good grade" fantasy, calling her "cum slut" and "useless fuckhole slut" wouldn't be appropriate here, but "you're good innocent girl"

and "you only doing this for good grades" and "you're bad, nice girl like you shouldn't be taking this hard cock inside of her" may be more appropriate.

Some other lines:

'is my whores cunt wet for my hard cock? '

'do you like how your clit feels rubbing the base of my cock as I fuck you hard ?'

'what will you do to please your master?'

' is my little fuck-toy ready to be played with? '

Kelly or I can cover more hardcore roleplay stuff if you're interested, I will post in this thread.

This may be not for everyone, but it should get the ball rolling.

USER : TheRogue

Great post!

Here's another fantasy you can add to the list:

Getting picked up at a club fantasy:

Show up at the same club as your gf, approach her, and pick her up like she's a stranger. Proceed to get her a drink, dance with her, make out with her, and take her home for some wild raging sex. What makes this sexy is that other people see you approach, and as far as they're concerned, you're the stud who just picked up a chick at the club, and she feels extra attraction towards you. In addition, she's doing something naughty (going home with a guy she "just met"), which plays a little bit on the slut fantasy.

Dirty talk that goes with it:

"What's a sexy girl like you doing in the club all by herself? "

"Come here and grind against my cock...good girl."

"Look at that guy eyeing you..I bet he's jealous that I have you rubbing against my cock right now."

"Look what you did you bad girl, you got my cock all hard in the middle of the club...what are you gonna do about it?"

"I'm gonna take you home, strip off that little dress of yours, and fuck your little pussy till you're screaming my name for the world to hear."

Proceed to take her home and have some of the best sex of your life USER : React

Good post, Daniel Rose's book "Sex God Method" explains these things pretty well also.

a magical line I got from someone on this site

Talking Dirty

USER : Squacks

Ok this place has given me so much so I thought I'd give back a bit. I've come up with a foolproof way of getting women to dirty talk. The trick just like in building attraction is to start slowly and progress. By the end you will have built up enough trust between you and her that she will readily scream for you. Women as we all know want to be dirty, crazy, and sexual aggressive but they want to know we won't judge them or think they're weird. I have always thought sex with a women in silence is boring so I began to say different things to evoke different responses. Some more successful than others. But I have finally perfected routine. Here's how I start.

When your messing around with her you don't even need to be having sex at this point say the following..."How does that feel," "Does that feel good," "Do you like that" They're all questions that will evoke a "good" or "yes"

response from a girl. You can start by either whispering it in her ear or saying it softly to her. Either way repeat this for a while, while you're stimulating her. There is no time frame on this you just need to find out how stimulated she is by her body language. But you should repeat this line a few times with a couple minutes between so not to sound too intrusive to her.

After things starting heating up, you say ALMOST identically what you've been saying with a few differences.

My favourite is "HOW MUCH do you like that," if she doesn't respond right away you say "TELL ME how much you like that," "Do you like that SO much" or "Does that feel SO good" etc......you build it up from there, always continually stimulating her and building her up. Her responses will usually be either "so good," "so much" ETC...(noticed the build up). If she says much more then that then you're def on your way. But this method is for women who have more of a difficult time than others. The ones who want to dirty talk will much faster. Once you can that response you can escalate further by saying......"how much do you need/want it." I like to use both. When you get to this point however, you must be more forceful because you are trying to evoke a larger response. You don't want to scream it but you want to use a powerful voice. They're very interchangeable and just like all of mystery's other methods if you build up the right way she will tell you things like. "I want you to fuck me so bad" "I need you inside me." These are just a few of the lines I use and they're def enough to get you started. I'll be happy to explain further but most important is the idea of a build up.

USER : Cue

what in the hell should I say if a girl asks me to talk dirty before sex and/or during sex?

USER : Satyre

This is a frame issue, some logistics for ya...

If, 1. You like sex and it makes you think sexually. (this should be a given) If, 2. You are confident with your actions and words.

If both 1 and 2 are true, then this shouldn't be an issue. You should say what you’re thinking and not concerned about what she'll think of you. Remember, she wants it, don't let your sex be passive.

USER : MDS

It's extremely exiting to most women when men talk dirty in bed. I had girls ask me the same also. I found out that they come much quicker and there's less foreplay needed when dirty talk is involved.

Here's what you should do:

Pg 127

1. Build it up slowly, don't just go into it right away, mix dirty talk with sensual talk. For example >> slam her against the wall, then gently kiss her, press her against yourself hard, then gently kiss her again, tell her to take off her clothes and that you wanna watch because you love the way her body looks 2. Tell her get on the bed, command her actually, touch her and tell her that you love her silky smooth skin, tell her that she looks innocent and beautiful, then follow it up with "but i know that you want me to fuck you like the slut that you are"

3. At this point you can use more dirty talk and less sensual, but still keep mixing it 4. Tell her to get on her hands and knees, grab her by the hair, slap her ass, fuck her hard 5. Things to say:

 I love how hard your nipples get

 Do you want my hard dick inside you

 Do you like it when I use you to get off

 You are my bitch

 Let me fuck you like you deserved to be fucked

 Come for me baby, come for me like the slut that you are

 Show me how you can come for me, come hard for me baby, come bitch, come like a good little girl

 Suck my hard dick, how does it feel, you like to suck it don't you. I love the way my hard dick feels inside your mouth/wet pussy

 Your pussy is getting wet, you feeling horny don't you, do you want me to give it to you like a slut/bitch that you are

 I love your ass, I’m gonna fuck you up the ass

 I’m gonna come inside your mouth, I want you to swallow it, you love it don't you

 I wanna come on your face/nipples/tits

 I love fucking you, I love coming inside you, I love to fuck you because you are my bitch/ slut I pretty much typed up everything that I say and most girls absolutely go crazy. they'll play along, I usually hear shit like:

 oh baby you make/drive me wild/crazy

 fuck me, fuck me hard, I want you to fuck me with your hard dick

 yes, I’m your dirty whore/slut/bitch

 come on me/inside me/in my mouth

But, be careful not every woman like this shit. the way to test it is again to start slowly. first try giving her commands like, take off your clothes, get on the bed, get on your knees. if she follows your commands and acts submissively chance are she will be into it. But a lot of times they will ask to talk dirty to them as they're comfortable with you. and make sure that you talk dirty in the bedroom only, women who enjoy this are actually extra sensitive to foul language in everyday life.

Most importantly, that whatever you do has to be done with confidence, you have to be congruent with it. of you think that she'll be offended by this, it will ruin your sex life. you have to believe 100% that your woman enjoys this.

btw, most of it I learned when my friend introduced me to David shade's stuff. I heard that he does telesemenars specifically on the subject of dirty talk.

phone sex

USER : skills

I’m sort of seeing this girl at the moment, but she lives north of where I do, about an hour or two by train..

and we keep talking and somehow our conversations lead to phone sex, yet we never have it.. I’ve been with her before, but never had phone sex..

I won't be able to see her for another 2 weeks, and till then want to give her something at least memorable, how will I manage that by phone sex? I’m a phone sex virgin, thanks..

USER : skills

I did at myself, went really well, she had an orgasm over phone..

anyways all I went for was as follows:

asked what she was doing..

said I was touching myself..

she started to the same..

asked her how many fingers..

I was asking her what she thought about..

asked her to put in another finger..

to move her fingers faster, as if I were going harder/faster..

asked her to talk about my dick..

and so on..

all went well

was actually not bad, you should go for it if you haven't before, let’s you express yourselves USER : Slide

I’ve had numerous PURELY phone sex buddies....never really had phone sex with an actual girlfriend or girl I was seeing....Just pure phone sex.... One girl had sent me "fake" pictures....and I knew it wasn't her..but fuck it, it was fantasy and I didn't give a shit..she was amazing at doing it and fucking got into it...so not like it mattered (I knew I would never see her anyways)....

Phone sex similar to the 3some thing Styles uses.....Make it her fantasy....Turn around the conversation....Get her to lay down or somewhere that she's comfortable...or alone.....baby steps at first "Do you wish I was there?"

"Don't you wish I was laying in bed with you right now? " "Imagine your arms wrapped around me and your head on my chest as we gaze into the ? of your room/night sky/etc etc"...."Think of my hands stroking through your hair sending shivers down your spine....with warmth emanating throughout your body..."

Carry through some of the Yes ladder (so she'll be responding with yes and she'll be more likely to keep it going....).....

Try to keep the focus on your giving her pleasure....U can be rock hard....and if she had indicated that before to you....try to transition into that phase....

"Remember that night when we XXXX" or "I can't stop thinking of when you XXXX" .....Hit all senses....scent, touch, taste (if dinner or food), visual (obviously), aural (which will be going on as it goes....little moans etc at the early start or hums).....

I’ve been lucky that usually I can find a freak right off and even if there’s no progression from the number to the night, I know I've got a good call for later that week or months or whenever.....

If you can spark some sort of sexual desire in her that whenever she thinks of you she gets wet....u are set....

Once you go through all that stuff above....keep up your work and push ahead....if she pulls away...validate it and say "I know - you're right, this is crazy.....I guess I just got caught up in our high....I guess I should go to Pg 129





sleep now....." ...SILENCE....... Then see her response.....be prepared to say goodbye and hang up....hell, jerk off after that b/c at least you'll be able to satisfy yourself and probably watch better porn Most likely, that silence will draw her back in....

Avoiding phone sex

USER : Kentrel

So here's something that will make many of you think I'm crazy. One HB I'm working at the moment is out of town right now, though we're staying in touch a lot. We haven't had sex yet, but unless the sun explodes it will definitely be happening when she's back.

Over the phone she tells me she's "incredibly sexually frustrated", and that her fuckbuddy is useless and can't wait to get back and get together. In the meantime she wants phone sex - badly. She keeps bringing it up, I always tease her and say stuff like "oh if you play your cards right", etc and that just drives her even more insane. I then try to change the subject and do more comfort+trust, which all combined is making her want sex even more now. For the first time in my life I wish a woman would stop being so impatient about sex!

The truth is I just don't want to do it. I think it's stupid sitting there in my living room telling this chick over the phone that "oh I'm squeezing your huge magnificent tits". I think it's lame. I think it's lamer than cyber sex, and that's pretty high on the lame scale. There's no way I can do that without laughing. Tits turn me on, talking about tits over a mobile phone while my neighbours blast out German opera for the tenth night in a row does not.

So what do I do? Do I just put on my best Oscar winning performance and blow her socks off, or should I tone down the teasing, and dirty sex talk, until she's here, and just tell her I think it's lame doing it over a phone. How do I do any of that and not DLV myself before she comes back.

USER : miaddict

A skilful PUA should be able to make her cum by several means(not just your dick, fingers and tongue).

Check your PM.

Use that HB as practice. Use NLP patterns to get sexual elicitation.

Phone sex is more than talking about CAT[cunt, ass, tits]. Phone sex is an art of oral pleasure by itself.

USER : Kentrel

Lol, yeah that's true, and I'll check out that site. I already use NLP\SS style stuff naturally and it's partly because of that that she's going so wild now.

Looking at it from your perspective though, it does seem more appealing and I might bust out some more SS for experimentation purposes.

This is a rare opportunity. Get on it before she goes out and handles it some other way.

Tell her exactly what you're going to do to her when she gets back. Go very slowly. Repeat as needed any phrase to which she responds strongly. Have her tell you what she's doing to herself as you talk. Give her what she wants, but make her promise to do certain very specific things to you when she gets back.

Unless you're confident in what you're doing you'll sound like a tool. Only have "phonesex" if you're confident in your abilities to do so successfully. I personally find phone sex to be totally retarded so I wouldn't do it. Just wait until she comes back and fuck her. Tell her to watch some porn or something in the meantime...

"show me your porn star face"

"tell me that you want it -- my big fat throbbing cock deep inside of you."

"you're such a dirty cock hungry slut"

The Slut Factor

USER : PineAppleJesus

The other day my friend (Nick would like to be recognised, if he appears on the forums it's Jack_Bauer) had a detailed conversation, while he was good and liquored up, about things he had done with his girlfriend and his basic game. (Nick is mostly a natural and I had no clue how much game he had in the 5 odd years I've known him. Recently he has benefited from my and The Great Jroc's exposure to the game as well) In this conversation Nick gave me three excellent sexual tips (one you most likely knew already if you're on this page) I, with his consent, would like to share with you all.

1. Dry Humping:

Apparently girls LOVE this, I personally had no idea. It's an excellent way to get really passionate and into it if your girl isn't ready for sex. Personally my girl ADORES it.

Pg 131

2. Basic Dominance:

While you are making out, or hopefully dry humping, take each of her hands by the wrists and position them over her head as if you are handcuffing her with one hand. By the end of my most recent experience with my girl she was actually talking (I use this loosely as she could barely form words) about how much she was into me being in control.

She was very into me being in control.

Also try hair pulling and pinning etc (just make sure she's not actually struggling, that's rape.) 3. The Slut Factor

This one shocked me the most. Everything I've learned in the game thus far has told me that girls don't want to be sluts. They want to think in their mind that it's "just happening". While I'm not denying this, in fact I agree entirely with it. But if you lean in while making out, dry humping, or fucking and whisper "You're my little slut" girls go fucking crazy. I have personally only experienced it. But Nick and my other friend (whom is extremely sexually versed.) can both vouch, and their girlfriends will back them up. Calling a girl a slut, whore, or anything else to that effect turns them right the fuck on.

To be honest I was a little reluctant with some of these (Guess which ones). But as soon as I took the chance I was rewarded nearly instantaneously. I'll be honest. I'm a virgin and my girl is not ready for sex yet. But last night I got the dry humping of my life. My dick was actually raw and she was nearly screaming throughout the hour or so (with small breaks) that we were doing it.

My thoughts on this are simply that in primal instinct, girls want to be whores but society tells them otherwise (cavemen had it easy). It's simply the Supreego (Freud anyone?) is in a lot of control with girls. But as soon as they get turned on enough or buying temperature is high enough they revert to their instincts. Which happen to be slutty and they want to KNOW that.

Dry-runs are great. Great way to mess a girl's pants up. Taking control is just alpha, chuck her around the room, most girls love it. Go animal hard & bruise 'em a little with a wallbanger. When she sees the bruise later she'll be reminded of the intensity. I would get texts like, "Just saw the bruise on my shoulder, thought of you. What are you doing tonight"

My reply-"Bruising your other shoulder."

What's wrong with you? If she struggles at all just smother her with a Pineapple... Jesus.

You know you have a tiger on your hands when she gets excited by hearing: "I promise that I won't let your head hit the wall without my hand behind it."

Grab a girl's hands & throw her against a wall, her hands above her & lock eyes with her before kissing her passionately. Combine this with some neck kisses & you'll soon have a crazed animal on your hands.

USER : AlexMoran

Or you can grab her firmly by the hips, knock her against the wall and then put her hands above her head with one hand and with the other grab her throat firmly for a second or two while you kiss her.

USER : RockHouse

While it is very arousing if done properly, I would refrain from chokin' a girl, even just slightly. But I have found that just a little pressure (just above a touch) on the side of her throat where the carotid artery is (it takes the blood to the brain) does very nicely. As long as you're not blocking off her oesophagus/wind pipe, you'll escalate this even more.

You can also try a little more pressure (just light of "gripping") on the side of the neck just before she comes.

It'll reduce blood flow to the brain only slightly and increase it. It's very close to strangulation but the risks are lower.

USER : LIBERTARIAN

Ok, maybe I tried point no.3 with the wrong girl.

We were getting into it, well that’s an understatement, I cleared the dining table with her ass, ripped her thong off, broke a vase on a nearby table I sat her on, she tore the buttons in my boxers off. It was pretty intense.

I was in her whilst I had her up against the wall. Banging like a hydraulic drill into her. She was loving it. I was thankful I had a few red bulls earlier on in the day.

Then I dropped the line, I thought as this was rough sex, dirty conversation would go hand in hand. I didn’t say it as if I was freddy crouger, nor did I say it as if I were romeo. It left my mouth with a hint of cheekiness/lust.

'your my little slut'

'What? Get off me! (what else can you say, if they take offence. As soon as it leaves your mouth it’s an unrecoupable advance.)

'Doors over there'

I’ve never tried it again. I feel disinclined to do so.

I will agree with quinja, girls like a bruise. Although not on the head. You know how it is when you get carried away in the 'what’s ma name!' position.

I’m sure we've all been there.

LIBERTARIAN, I think what happened in your case is comfort level. Next time just start small, for example you can whisper in her ear "you like that?". Delivery is KEY for these kinds of situations. From my experience if you play your cards right a girl will do anything for you in bed. Think of it as SEX GAME, the more barriers you break down the more turned on she will be and she will be more willing to please you in any way you want.

USER : LIBERTARIAN

Haha, you must think I’m some kind of lemon! Dude, I didn’t just come out with it! There was a build up.

I guess some girls will just take offense no matter what.

I think it requires a type of girl to accept such language. Not a liberal one. If you know what I mean.

Hey guys, this is a great thread!

I do all the shit you're talking about Connaissance... I guess I've been playing about with the whole male multiple orgasm thing. I've only managed that twice though almost by accident after doing a lot of those Kegel exercises during the day.

Ryd... How long exactly are we talking? I'm maxed out at just under 2 hours when I start to feel my cock getting a bit softer and always deliberately finish up rather than lose the erection. Got any advice for me?

Someone said something about positions. This is very important; there are lots of positions you can do that the girls haven't experienced before. I think a good thing to do is see how you can transition between them smoothly so that you have several different cycles or routines of positions that flow together nicely. Anyone found any awesome combos?!

By the way, I really like to read David Shade. I have found the 'Welcomed Method' to be awesome. My GF

calls it 'the amazing thingy'! I've tried to do some of Shade's hypnotism stuff but didn't go all the way because I wasn't sure if she was actually hypnotised or not... She just seemed different in a really tired/drowsy way. By the way guys... the whole dirty talk thing is so awesome. They totally love it and usually don't experience it properly. I always thought that fucking without speaking much would be kind of weird. You'd be surprised how dirty they like it sometimes. You can pull their hair and call them dirty fucking sluts. Sometimes they'll even join in and beg to be treated like a fucking whore. Enjoy it guys.

Anyway, I think the thread asked for somewhat original ideas...

I like to leave messages during the day about what is going to happen at night. I'll be like 'Tonight you'll be participating in a night of wine, massage and oral sex. Don't be late you nasty bitch'. Don't tell them everything that's going to happen though!

Also, you guys should check out bondage tape. You can find it online and it looks like duct tape but it only sticks to itself so its painless to remove. You can do all sorts of fucked up shit with it.

Reverse psychology works in orgasm control/denial as well.

Within moments of my saying "don't you fucking DARE come without permission slut" my girl starts begging frantically due to the implied suggestion that she is close and must hold back.

USER : mookeyjones

Every woman is different in what she responds to, but here's what consistently works best for me...

Pg 134

Fuck her mostly missionary style. It's the best way for her to feel your dominance. Plus, most women have trouble orgasming if you change positions more than once. For this reason I rarely do anything but missionary.

When you fuck her missionary, grab her hair with your fist. Sometimes I'll use both fists. Then pull her down with your clenched fists as you thrust up. What this will do is cause your cock to hit the front wall of her vagina as well as the G-spot. If find that women who can have a vaginal orgasm are more likely to have one with this technique. While you're doing this talk dirty to her. The dirtier the better. I get very rough and aggressive with this - my arms and shoulders go through quite a workout here. I also put all of my weight on her with no regard to her comfort. I find that this provides her with greatest feeling of dominance which helps her come. A woman's orgasm is more psychological than anything else.

If you can give a woman consistent vaginal orgasms, you will own that pussy forever and completely control the frame with her whether it's an exclusive or a nonexclusive relationship. If, on the other hand, it's a one night stand, then don't worry about giving her an orgasm and just concentrate on whatever experience you'd like to have with her.

One other thing. You have to be careful about eating pussy. Even if you're good at, it can backfire on you. Even though you may give a woman an orgasm, it won't allow her to feel dominated. So even though I've gotten very good at eating pussy over the years, I find myself doing it less and less.

To be the best sex she's ever had, you must make her feel completely dominated. All of your technique should go toward fulfilling this objective.

USER : iamthecheese

you are the prime mover!:

having sex on the kitchen floor is not very surprising.

starting out in the bedroom and ending up on the balcony is way cooler.

the first step out of bed is the most fun. carry her around, fuck her where you want.

tell her she has to be quite (neighbours parents roommates/ whatever) and how hot it is that she can’t do it.

turns her on and makes it easy to start dirty talk ("we gotta be quite..we will wake up everybody... oh, you are nasty... I love that...")

putting two fingers in her mouth and telling her to bite you/ give feedback by biting/ whatever (I mostly initiate it while doggystyle, I think it might be weird if you look in her face while doing so). if done while telling her to be quite it seems very natural. gives her some kind of control and therefore makes things more interesting, especially if you are very dominant.

I just listened to some of David Shade's CDs and also from what you guys have been saying, and it seems like dirty talking helps spice up the experience a lot. It’s something I've never really done before, so I was just wondering...

Do you guys talk dirty to her in your first encounter? How long do you wait before you do it? I mean, maybe it’s just because I've never really done it before, but it seems to me like if I said some of this stuff, I'd get slapped in the face or something :-P

A rule of dirty talk Gauntex: If you call her a 'dirty cock sucking slut' when you are meeting her mom and dad for the 1st time (or her pals) she will hate you forever!

When you call her a 'dirty cock sucking slut' when she is sucking your cock-she will love it and lust for you and get more into getting nasty!

LOL!

Context....

I always talk dirty w/ a HB, right from the 1st time we share the thrill of having great sex.

I start by talking ABOUT ME and how she is effecting me. "Baby, my cock is getting so hard. You made my dick hard - just for you!"

Then in the process I comment on the obvious about her "You are soooo wet already! Look at that wet little pussy.... That is a pretty pussy baby!"

I finger her and show her the stickiness she made. (have her taste it too!) She is wet so DUH! it’s cool to say it at that point.

Tart, Bitch, Slut, Tramp, Whore, Cunt, Pussy, Fuck Hole, Nasty Cooze/Slit/Gash-all are mean things to say to a HB out of the bed room setting. In the bed room tho-they are taboo words and b/c of that taboo TRIGGER

SUPER SEXUAL RESPONSE in her when they are used.

The act of fun (or loving) sex that the 2 of you share transmutes the dirty words into kink and into lust accelerators. They are gold to fire off when you are fucking.

To get her to open up a bit just say, "Oh, you wet bitch! You feel so good!" Your tight pussy feels so nice!"

Then say "You're a good little slut! You're a wicked little potty mouth aren't you?!" "Tell me how good my cock feels baby! Tell me how much you love to get fucked! Right in your tight pussy! Say it!"

To call her a "Spunk Mouth" or "Potty Mouth" are nice cues for her to start talking dirty. She will always say

'fuck me' and generic stuff like that. Near all HBs do.

Get her to go more and more dirty. "Where should I fuck you with my hard cock baby?"

"Fuck me! Fuck my pussy!" will be her reply. Or maybe "Fuck my ass!" NICE! That has happened a few times when I did not scan for it even! LOL! Then fuck her asshole! BONUS!!! LOL! Keep up the dirty talk tho.

Pg 136

She will get into the dirty talk and it will advance from there. Trust me.;-) Call and response is a fine move (me)"You want me to pound your pussy hard baby?" (HB)"Yes, fuck me!

Pound my pussy hard!" Stuff like that while I'm thrusting away inside of her.

She loves to talk nasty and she loves for you (in the sex context) to do the same. Be bold as a man needs to be and do dirty talk right from the 1st time she gives you head. "Suck my cock! Yeah, baby! Suck my dick princess! Oh, that feels nice..."

Try it and you'll see! Listen to Shade again and again. His woman said that once she fucked a dude (AFC) and she was trying to get him to talk nasty. "Come on! Fuck your Bitch!" she coaxed. He (AFC) panicked "You’re not a bitch!" Loser! She said she never saw him again after that (she broke it off). LOL! Girls, in the height of passion, want and carve to be stimulated over the edge and ravished. Dirty talk is one hell of a grand tool to use to get that result!8-)

Once you can get her into the mode of having sex-then the 'rules' or manners and politeness flip. Normally telling her she is a whore and to lick your ass is rude (like on a date in a nice restaurant LOL! :lol::-P)- in the context of sex tho ITS RUDE TO NOT say those things to her.

What does dirty talk (use of rude words) do Gauntex? It alerts ppl.

Call a woman a 'Bitch' on the street or in the club and watch her alert to you (in a bad way. Are you dangerous and want to attack her? Are you mean and antisocial?). More so then just saying "Hey lady!"

Say "Hey Lady!" in the bedroom. "Hey Lady What?" Will be her reply. LOL!

Say Bitch to her (cunt, pussy, whore) in the context of sex and she will alert to you and it will thrill her. You rub her clit and her body/sex energy alerts to that, you kiss her w/ passion and she alerts-same w/ dirty talk. She alerts (aka arouses and arousal) and it is good.

I did a post on that dirty talk as alerting. Go search for it.:-) When you are having loving sex-ease back on the dirty talk (sweet talk on how close you feel to her by being inside of her). For the lustful banging tho-let it nasty words fly! She'll love you for it.

--------------------

A move I'll share is a simple but powerful one.

Not all sex tips are about esoteric energy and fancy acrobatics and secret hand moves to finger her with and such.

The simple act of being in charge and keeping this dominance in small but potent ways all through the sex act is one that makes a regular guy a better (or master ) lover.

Okay we all need to change positions doing sex (for many reasons).

SO just go from missionary to doggy by having her flip and then fuck her some more I do it differently.

Pg 137





I am on top in missionary. I grab her hips, turn her to the side and then turn her doggy. I physically reposition her into where I want her. I may or may not pull out to do so. I hold her the whole time I turn her-my hands grasping her and controlling her.

This is simple but so much more powerful and makes more meaningful connection w/ her then just telling her to get doggy and letting her move her body on her own.

I pose her like she is my living fuck doll. Its subtle but meaningful.

Try it next time. You are stronger then she is any way-so grabbing (tender but firmly) her body to hit poses for you (sex poses) is a great alpha way to make good fucking even more submissive for her and more fun for the 2

of you (for the times when she is fully submissive to you-some times its 50/50 power play).

Manhandling her and posing her is a power sex move!8-)

Till next time! Keep having fun and keep having great sex w/ you lovers!:smile::-):-D

Create a fantasy with you two in it. Fuck her in the back of a car while your friends are driving the car up in front and they don’t notice so it’s your little dirty secret with her. Talk dirty to her, ALL women like it. "Oh yeah babe, I love it when my cock is deep inside you." "Your pussy feels so warm" etc. Eventually, you get better and better at this with more practice.

Foreplay is always exciting before sex. Recently, me and my main gf went to the beach with a few friends. We had a small signal (holding the hand and squeezing) as a sign of we want some .."attention". So while we were talking to our friends, we were rubbing each other with our hands, kissing each other in the spots we like to be kissed, etc. Again the whole concept with "our little dirty secret and no one else knows" thing comes to play here.

Let her know that she isn't some sex doll and that you care about her, but at the same time call her YOUR little dirty slut. Make sure she knows that she is with you and only you at the moment. Read "The Secret Garden" for more fantasy ideas.

Read this on another forum. It's a post a woman made on Craig's list. Good stuff. Never underestimate the basics. They'll never steer you wrong.

Most women like dirty talk, in addition to the grunting. If you'd like to get some dirty talk going, ask her if she likes the way you fuck her. If she responds well, continue with something like, "I love fucking you.

God, you look so fucking hot." Is she still moaning in response? "Your tits are so beautiful." Does that work? If she doesn't respond well to the term "tits", you might have to stop there. If she keep moaning or responding, pass Go and collect $200. Try the following:

"Oh, god. Your pussy is SO tight."

"You're so wet - are you wet because you like the feel of my cock ramming you?"

"I think I'm going to come inside you. I'm going to fill up your little cunt." It doesn't matter that you're wearing a condom; we LOVE hearing this.

If all of those work, you can then progress to things like "sexy little bitch" and "dirty whore". Tread carefully, but please, tread. Do not tiptoe. Do not sit down. Charge

hey I’ve never used dirty talk while sex, but I couldn’t get my girlfriend to orgasm. so I read up some sex god method by daniel rose and tried some of the stuff.

and it works like a charm! it’s the first time I could get her to orgasm vaginally (actually the first time I got ANY girl to orgasm vaginally) and she loves it! currently I’m only using softer stuff like telling her how good she feels, how much I like her, what a dirty little girl she is, that she is mine now and that I own her pussy, etc.

What works especially well is when she’s about to climax I say "yes baby cum for me" and repeat it hypnotically!

I want to slowly move on to harder stuff like calling her my slut/whore and making her call me daddy or master and all that stuff. This is very exciting for me too and it adds a whole new dimension to sex IMO!

"you wanna get fucked don’t u?"

"I have u where I want u now ..what u gonna do about it”

"your tight little pussy wants my cock..but I don’t think u can take it"

etc etc

I gave her the condom and she put it on me with her mouth and started blowing me. I got on top and started to fuck her. and fuck her and fuck her...followed by more fucking till I got bored. I turned her around and continued. All the while giving her sexy dirty talk. I fucked her for a long time and didn’t nut. I got a little bored to be honest and I started to go soft. So I stopped.

I got off and went up stairs to have a quick shower. Lightening quick. When I returned she started giving me a handjob again and I lied down next to the fire and she started to blow me. She slipped on a condom and I told her to ride my dick. Did that for at least 15 mins before I turned her over and began fuckin her in missionary.

For ages. I know how to work her G-Spot and altered positions where I would directly feel it. I could feel it with Pg 139





my cock from the positions .

I really started railing her hard. HARD. VERY HARD. Constant 80% pounding for like 15-20 mins. I was telling her that her pussy belongs to me and I’m fucking it the way I want and that I’m having my way with her body because I’m soooooo bad and I’m making her do such bad things. She really whimpered when she heard it

I took my target to the other side of the bar doing kino. We sat side to side and I escalated talked. "I feel so relaxed and upbeat with u... Stop casting a spell on me woman!" I teased her and play pushed her away. "Stand up. Wow! U have a dancers butt! Very sexy!" I smiled. "Come dance for me!" She said no. I said, " U know u want to!" I took her by the hand. (Players u need to TAKE THE PUSSY! Get it?) She came with me and we started to grove. This is a tavern so its limited dancing area and we were off near the corner. I had her in front of me and she started to grind her ass on my cock. "Oh baby how u are! Ur sweeping that cute little butt on my crotch! So naughty!" I encouraged her.

I stepped it up, "Baby, be practical with me. Ur horny now aren't u?" She said she was. "Good! Get ur coat and say goodbye to ur pals. I'm going to take u away for the night." She said she couldn't. I laughed. "Baby, of course u can't! It would be so, so wrong to just leave ur pals and go and seek pleasure... But then again... They are doing just fine, they may hook up, and they need to hear afterwards all the juicy details of all that u got to enjoy. They crave it! I know ur a naughty little sex gossip!

U make me feel so good... " I kissed her and started to rub her lower back. "It great to release fully into the thrill for sexual pleasure... It shows how any small contrast can give back." She did not follow. Good-I was setting her up."It is very much the way we as ppl have logic and emotions and how we can choose to control ourselves and get more of one and let go and receive more of one.. the one we want and the one that feels best to us. Logic and emotions are energies-energies like sounds. Like the sound of my voice. They are differential. U know what I mean baby?" She said no. " It works on differences-u know this already. Its math baby. 10 and 7 subtracted is the difference of 3. It’s just taking away one by subtraction and leaving the other in this form. U know that it’s true that we as ppl have funny minds...

Now our logic says that of course we never want 2 think of our parents as sexual-but all little girls think of their daddy’s and have sexual wants for their daddy’s. Logic comes in and is good to stop this. Emotions drive the sexual feels of little girls to their daddy’s tho. As adults we have powers of logic and emotions and can tune then to experience more of what we want to get. Good emotions and feelings... U have these same emotions and can tune down logic to let emotions flow and give u a new fantasy thrill... When 2 sound are in the room u can hear both. The louder is heard more. 2 make it heard more u can turn up the volume or u can have the 2nd sound just fade away. 1st is a 10 the second is a 6.... The 4

is what u hear as a differential mix... the six fades and u hear only the 10... emotion is a 10 and logic is a 6 the 6

fades and the emotional 10 is all that u feels now.. and it feels good..."

I rub her back and kiss her some more. "I know that u see daddy and being the good little girl u are u feel that daddy is so powerful and so sexy to u. U want daddy to love u like the man he is... Daddy sees u too...Daddy sees his little angel become what she is... Daddy sees how she is dressing and how she moves...

Pg 140





Daddy knows how she loves to tease the boys and how she will not give them what they are after... She wants to save it 4 daddy.... Daddy's little girl wants his love... she needs his lust...

Daddy is going to give her all she craves now... daddy’s hard cock is just for his sweet little princess...

Daddy’s dick is 4 u!!!"

I mounted her and put my cock in. "Oh, that little pussy feels so good to daddy’s cock! Make daddy feel good sweetie! Yeah, u were so jealous of how mommy always gets to enjoy daddy cock-but now u get it!

Now daddy’s dick is in u! IT is al 4 u sweetie!

Daddy likes fucking his sweet little princess! Good girl! Take daddy’s cock!"

I could type 60 lines of the nasty shit I said but u get the picture...

And so on... Hot shit! She got super wild and was saying fucking me daddy and give me all ur cock daddy!

Very Hot! Try it! It is really as the Sex Revolution Book says it is... Fun and powerful! She told me that no man ever pushed her like that in bed be 4! I rock! Try it 4 urself and enjoy it too!

CHAT : Talking during sex

USER : bhzmafia

After losing my v-plates over the weekend I realised I was very quiet during sex... In fact I don’t think we said anything. What do you normally talk about during sex. Obviously it won’t be a conversation, but what is normally said?

USER : sputnik

listen to blissnosis

it will show you some examples.

david shade has an audio cd on dirty talk.

otherwise it is just confirmations to the girl that you are feeling good and that you like what you are doing +

commands for her what to do.

it does feel weird at first and I think most men are silent at first (and maybe even later) USER : sinatra

I love to whisper in her ear what I would like to do to her, and how it would make her feel in her body USER : Maximus86

We have two porno's here. Talk Dirty to Me and Nothing to Hide. Also going Mode One on a girl can help you to naturally start dirty talk in bed since you often start it during the pickup.

USER : HighJ85

I like the "sex revolution handbook". It has some great examples of what to say, and after that you know kinda in which genre works for you.

I think it's called the "sex god method" now.

Dirty talking / talking under sex is a powerful tool, and should be used.

Giving commands, dominating her, telling your feelings for her, just be over the whole emotional spectrum

A sidenote.

When talking, the immersion level is in my opinion an important factor for what works and what doesn't. The more immersed in the sex, the more extreme I find you can take the "dirty talk".

If she isn't ready and horny, it doesn't help very much to make her beg for it, just comes off as awkward and inexperienced, f you cannot read her mood, I think!

USER : darkness

I just say shit like

"You smell so fuckin good"

"Your body is so sexy" - if she ain’t a fatty

"I love your tits"

USER : Oldeman

Definitely read David Shade. If you haven't gotten good at dirty talk, you won't have anything to fall back on when she starts talking about Quantum Mechanics. Dirty talk is the trump card. You can play it any time or play it when you really need it.

After you have read David Shade, you can consider whether or not to talk about other things during sex. If you want her to give you instructions on what makes her feel good, first be sure your ego can handle it. When you have enough confidence and experience, you'll be comfortable with anything.

Just don't ask her if you are doing it right, or other wussy questions. Your penis is big enough. When you have convinced her, she'll tell you, especially if you have made her comfortable with the dirty talk.

USER : Illusionist

While having sex with a woman, she is in her most vulnerable and suggestive state. While David Shade's dirty talk is great, you can actually get your woman to agree to ANYTHING.

Persuasion happens in her vagina

CHAT : Not feeling much during sex

USER : Mohican

Guys, I've recently started seeing a girl who was a virgin. In fact, when I first penetrated her I doubted she was a virgin coz no hymen was broken and no blood. But last night I've fucked her 7th time and suddenly we noticed that sheets were in blood so I guess her hymen was broken at last.

The thing that concerns me is that I don't feel much during sex with her. I feel something and I can fuck her in condom for like 20-25 minutes and then I cum no problem...but during the process I don't feel my penis is stimulated the way I want it. For some reason the grip is not tight enough, even though this girl obviously was a virgin before me.

Pg 142

We tried missionary position and the stimulation is not very good for me. I even used VIZIT ultra-thin condom.

Then I put her on a table and fucked her like this.. I even tried to put her legs together while she was lying on her back and I was fucking her...but it doesn't add any significant effect.

So her pussy feels pretty tight on the entrance but I feel lack of stimulation when I'm moving inside her vagina and I often lose erection as a result of that.

I've been virgin myself before fuckin' this girl..so I cannot compare with other girls pussies. But if anyone knows, tell me, why this might be happening?

Is my cock not thick enough?:-) (well, I buy standard size condoms and it still takes a bit of effort to put them on my cock..so I'm not like the size of pencil :lol:).. Or maybe her vagina-structure is a bit large... even though she was a virgin and not fucked enough..

She doesn't feel very much too I think.. I can stimulate her Deep-Spot with my finger and she responds reasonably good to it but I don't see any better reaction when I fuck her with my cock.

What can be done about it? Does anyone have some Penis Size/Thickness table so I could check myself. :-D

USER : Mohican

Oh, I really adore her body and make her feel beautiful..maybe I've overdone talking dirty to her during our last encounter and talking about erotic fantasies.. but she responded very well to this.. she played along even when I called her "my bitch".. I introduced this word into our bedroom lexicon accidentally: I couldn't find my pants when I entered the bedroom. And I asked her "Have you stolen again my pants?" (and in my language it accidentally sounded like "Have you taken again my pants bitch?" even though I didn't mean calling her a bitch at all but it just SOUNDED like this)..so the girl is like "What was that word you said?!!!"

Me "Do you think I just said 'Have you taken again my pants bitch?':-D No,I didn't :-D:-D.. and we laughed it off..

later I called her "my little bitch" and told her how wet she was for me..

I use this along with sensual talk calling her my sweet little girl and telling her how great it feels to me inside her pussy... and how feminine, sweet and vulnerably beautiful she is under me when I fuck her in missionary...and how much of a bad girl she is when I fuck her on the table.

Totally: she can let herself go but she probably doesn't climax during foreplay and sex. Or she's just not vocal enough.. Obviously I don't want to ask her this stupid question "Have you had an orgasm?"..:-) USER : ubra

I saw she was enjoying herself but thought she didn't get off a single time. well...

about asking: if you do it right afterwards, yeah, that's stupid. but talking about it some other time is perfectly fine. I'd encourage you to do that. the two of you will start to understand each other better and it'll bring you closer. just don't ask directly after sex. :-)

wow..thanks bro. I'd never think about this detail.

I also have this concern that I might "spoil her for LTR" as a result of introducing dirty talk into our sexlife, calling her "my bitch" etc... or discussing sexual fantasies with her..

I'm still not natural with this stuff so it's fake-it-till-u-make it for me and it probably doesn't sound very congruent yet. While I do all the above (dirty talk, fantasy discussion) with her she still giggles sometimes but plays along most of the time. and I joke about it too coz she removes all the seriousness from my sentences like

"Oh, I can really feel now how wet your pussy is..and how it wants to be penetrated with my hard cock".. she's like "oh, yeah...we really should put a sausage into the cat:-)" I just cannot hold myself seriously when she says shit like this :lol:

What's been your experience with dirty talk? I'm kinda afraid that I'll corrupt her too much for being LTR if I use hardcore dirty talking on her..

USER : ubra

dirty talk isn't my thing at all... you'd have to ask someone else for advice on that. in fact, I don't talk much before, during or after sex at all. I'm all about being completely in the moment, sensuality, intensity, playing, teasing and guiding her mostly non-verbally. I read her body language and talk to her by action. to me, that's the

"real conversation" during sex.

that's just my style, though... but it happens to work very well for me and the girls I'm with.

=> find your own style that works for you and don't try to copy others or some techniques too much. sex is all about being in the moment.

USER : Mohican

well mate, I'm starting to treat this girl like..if not a slut...but my wet little bitch whom I adore at the same time..

I really let myself go when I touch her body, talk about her body..even when I spread her butt to look at her pussy and asshole it turns me on and I tell her about it..

at the same time I guess she knows that I value her as a human being, as supportive, caring, helping and nurturing person in my life coz she's been really eager to help me with many things and I like this a lot about her.. I guess this thing creates balance in my attitude to her.. because I really want to give her different emotional experiences and for my own pleasure too.

CHAT : It's all about SEX, but we rarely talk

USER : jason

It blows my mind how little time most people in this community invest into learning about sex, and how to satisfy a woman. I strongly believe that your game will SKYROCKET, once you know that you could pretty much satisfy any woman you'd meet! There's just something very powerful about knowing that you could give any girl the time of her life... and give her better sex than 99% of all other men out there.

Guys, seriously stop wasting your time learning about fancy techniques or routines. I feel like too many people are losing sight of what this is all about. It's about SEX. If you're a master in the bedroom, everything else will fall into place. Good sex will make girls stay with you, no matter what... you can be broke, ugly, or live with your parents. Finding a guy who's good in bed is VERY rare for a women. It's like winning the lottery for them, or being able to date a rich movie star.

Pg 144

Now some may say that the only way to learn about sex is by actually having it, but I disagree. There are a ton of products on here who can teach you about sex. You may not be able to learn pickup by watching videos or reading books, but it can be accomplished with sex (to a certain degree).

And if you have to, get yourself a fake vagina from a sex shop, so you can "learn". I'm serious here. Do everything you can to educate yourself about sex, it's the single most important aspect of PU.

Some good products to check out:

I do, and I'm sure jason too had realized that women can't fuck a long time ago. You train your woman to be a good lay , to give a good head, to talk dirty or whatever but it's not just about receiving pleasure

- but by giving it as well knowing your thing around her genitalia and enhancing you and hers experiences.

What's the difference between the sex you describe and masturbation?just get yourself a daily 50$ that will please you. Who needs sex with real people?

As a man both socially and biologically you are born with amazing privileges.You can design your reality and create the life you imagine, you can tame a bitch down with your male energy and train her to fit that reality, those aren't duties man but things you were given as gift.

Don't be afraid to use those abilities.

What siliwolf said. YOU TRAIN YOUR CHICK TO FUCK LIKE A PORNSTAR! Roony, if the chick is giving you bad head, YOU TELL HER WHAT AND HOW TO DO IT. Women ain’t no mindreaders.

How are they supposed to know what you want if you don’t have the balls to tell em?

"Moan louder bitch"

"Look at me when you blow me... now lick my balls! "

"Turn around, I'm gonna fuck you from behind now"

YOU are the man. Tell her what you want, and she'll adapt to it. She's a woman, she WANTS to get told what to do... at least in bed! Hell, most women are insecure as fuck when it comes to sex. Most are afraid to go wild in bed. It's your job to lead!

USER : narcissist

I agree... to an extent.

If you know you are good at sex, you don't worry so much about all the PU stuff. But having sex is the same as having conversation, you can get a few fundamental tips by reading about it... but what really matters is your adaptation skills, and your ability to pay attention to another person.

Each person is different, in conversation, and in bed. Having a repertoire of things to try is good, but more important are gauging and calibration skills. If you can gauge her levels of pleasure and involvement, and calibrate the techniques you are using, you are set. So yeah, having confidence in your sexual ability will add huge amounts of confidence to your game... but you won't learn it from any books. Just like there are

"social robots" when it comes to PU, there are "sexual robots" too. Just have fun, be attentive, and always be adaptable to the situation.

CHAT : Getting It In

Alright, I've been having sex with this girl (she's the only one I've (edit) stuck my dick into as of now) and I always have trouble (I say always, this was the second time we've done it) getting it in. She's very tight, and I'm not at my hardest. Is there a way to work around this or fix it? I'm not entirely sure what's going on with her.

USER : joeypete

The mechanics have been said be4! LOL!:-D Arouse her and use lube. Getting her off 1st is a good call for many reasons! When she comes her pussy balloons and opens. Give her a G-Spot cum after an outside clit orgasms and she will be more ready to take u inside her.

Also make sure that u are as hard as u can get to be. Have her work on u till it’s like steel. On ur own do PC and taoist sex training for harder boners. Matters of Size cock exercises are great for over all dick health. In a month u will feel more solid in ur hard on.

Now for the act....

Make her feel wonderful and awesome for being tight! Tell her you love how tight and wet she it. Tell her it makes u lust for her and feel so good to get inside her tight, sung pussy.

Make her feel good about it. Tell her how hard she gets u and how it makes u feel so good.

When u finger her (1 or 2 inside) comment how great it feels to have her tight snatch gripping like that.

Doggy and pile driver are the 2 positions where a HB is most tight. Do not 1st get in her by those. Spooning her side to side/back to front or have her on top is a good to start off w/.

GENERAL : Vaginal orgasm

USER : Rhodes

Hoping some sex monsters can help me out here. I'm having trouble getting my girl to have a vaginal orgasm. I can nail the clit one most of the time but the vaginal is giving me some trouble. I've read the Sex Revolution Handbook and I think pretty much all of David Shade's stuff except the Inner Circle stuff and I'm pretty sure I understand the principles in this material and have applied them. Still nothing? I don't want to ask her if she's had vaginal orgasms from other guys before because quite frankly, that's information I don't want to know :-P

and it's not like we've talked about it because I don't want to put further pressure on it. What's a guy with an average sized dick and a whole folder of sex material to do? :lol: EDIT: just asked her and she says she's never orgasmed from straight sex and doesn't think she can.

USER : mah0r0matic

Man if you have read the sex god method then apply it. Psychological stimulation!

Use dirty talk during sex, it worked wonders for me.

That’s exactly the issue Daniel rose talks about in his book, don’t look for right technique but instead fuck her mind.

My last gf she would get very excited but wouldn’t come from fucking, I couldn’t push her over the edge. When I started implementing dirty talk she would come all the time. I just whispered hypnotic stuff in her ear like

"come for me baby" over and over. This stuff works!

Or this switching emotion thing he describes in the book its awesome! At one point you be all emotional and fuck her gently "ooh baby I love you so much" and then you switch to hardcore aggressive fucking and calling her names lol. Might feel a bit schizophrenic at first but she loved it. Make sure to actually feel the emotion behind it because she will feel it too.

Best thing is I always was resistant to this dirty talk stuff and found it corny but when I actually tried the stuff from sex god method I found out I LOVE THIS SHIT!! Lol

All my sex before that was just mechanical, boring in-out.

FIELD REPORTS FORUM : LR: I am the VIRGIN SURGEON

USER : BradP

…

Anyway, here's how things progressed from opening the set to the BJ. I'm thinking we might go for the full monty tonight, we'll see.

I opened her with horse girl. She had 5 female friends with her and they stood by and watched the whole thing audience style. I vibed with the friends a bit, then went off to handle other stuff. I checked in with her again a bit later, and this girl was unusually witty and interesting. Tall, beautiful girl, works in the movie business, Pg 147

amazing sense of humour, very flirty but a total good girl. I did some heavy sexual sub-communication very early on that went like this.

"Hmm, I think you're not really the type to wear clear high heels and a stripper dress. I think you're more the type for black lingerie. You're a naughty girl with an overactive imagination, but you're also a classy kind of girl."

She liked that. I guess you could call it a sexual cold read. I love to do cold reads that relate to the sexual dichotomy of women. The good girl/bad girl tension.

….

So I had a long talk with her to try to figure out why she was a virgin at age 23. Was it by choice? Due to religion? Did her uncle touch her in her spot? What could it be? Turns out that in Texas there's a lot of religious guys. So she ended up dating these really great guys, but they were waiting for marriage. There were times she wanted to have sex but couldn't. She had never even touched a penis. We had a really nice talk about it. I told her I was a bad candidate for losing virginity, and since she was leaving to go back to Texas in a month it probably isn't gonna happen. Of course she agreed and that was that. Then I did some crazy dirty talk to her. I made her close her eyes and imagine a sexual scenario which I described in great detail. This went on for about 20 minutes. She was getting really turned on. I ended up wacking off and blowing a load on her, which was a totally new experience for her. It was very exciting to her I think.

….

I'm thinking that with this virgin chick there were many factors that led to success. Complete detachment from outcome. Total indifference. Combine that with massive sexual vibe, dirty talk, adventure, and solid game overall. It was also a matter of having the right instincts in the moment-she texted and I immediately seized on it to go to her place. I just gently pushed when I got there and everything went very smoothly. It's a matter of being open to the opportunities that are right in front of you sometimes.

USER : OceanEyes

Brad, 3 of the LRs I posted here were with chicks that hadn't been laid in years. None of them were virgins, but it was similar insofar as I presented the frame of "I don't give a shit if we fuck or not, you're still pretty cool chick, and I am definitely NOT Mr. Right."

USER : BradP

Yeah sure I can elaborate on the dirty talk thing. I've explained this in previous LRs, but I’ll tell it again cause I think that was a while ago.

It's really simple. you just describe a sexual situation in vivid detail. All the slow escalation. Make sure the escalation you describe is non-linear and includes lots of teasing. For example-

"I know what you like. You'd like it if I took you, laid you down in my bed and got on top of you, then put my lips right next to yours. You can feel the anticipation of kissing me building up, but I wouldn't let you have it yet. I'd kiss your neck very slowly first, till you couldn't stand it anymore....."

then talk about kissing her on the lips, making her wait, squeezing her whole body, kissing her more, taking off her shirt, stopping, making her wait while you kiss her neck again, then touching breasts, then back to biting her neck....all the way up to intercourse.

It can get really long and drawn out and that's the way you want it to be. Take a really slow pace with it.

And get right in the girl's ear while you do it. Whisper the whole thing. Touch her while you do it, but not too much. Most of the excitement should take place in her mind.

Pg 148

USER : LowRider69

So we had to go to 3 different stores looking for VHS and we got this terrible 80s B movie called

"Rappin'." We watched that and I did some excellent escalation.

...could you give some details? was there any resistance?

I'm gonna need that load later with HBfetish and who knows what else. I decide not to spooge but I'll see how

far I can take it otherwise. Sometimes if you get hard and fuck or get a BJ, then stop without coming, it results in you blowing a really big load later on.

ROTFL... "load maintenance" ...

You're right though, if you fool around and don't blow your load, gives you SUPER CHARGED sexual state.

I'd recommend zinc tablets (50-100mg) - awesome for recharging libido

"Anywhere you want." I got her on her knees and blew a load in her mouth. She swallowed it all and was beautifully submissive throughout the entire event.

Nice. She’s a keeper...

USER : BradP

Yes, load maintenance. of course if we're gonna talk about that, we'll have to post in ADVANCED.

It's funny that second date there wasn't much resistance till she was naked. Then it came all at once. the resistance I mean, hehe. I think it's probably a bit shocking to some girls to have a guy get them naked so fast, they're like WTF just happened? Some would say slow it down and maybe there's less resistance. I'm thinking I'd rather have that shock value of "whoa, I’m naked. he must be a stud."

didn't get to see her tonight and might not see her till after cliffs list cause I’m going to Seattle sundae and I have missions all weekend, but I might try to go tuck her in again one night this week.

Re: load maintenance. FWIW, in Chinese medicine, it's considered very unhealthy for a man to ejaculate every day after about age 25 -- draining Chi. You're almost 30 Brad. You might want to consider doing some physical sexual training.

First you'll need to strengthen your chi muscle. Try the book "The Multi-orgasmic Man" to find out how the Taoists do it.

My acupuncturist recommends ejaculating no more than 1x/week for men in their 30s (I'm 32). Brad, you cannot IMAGINE the incredible high you get by not coming, over and over again... one of the best feelings I've ever had... and you get super horny but super chill, it's awesome. My current level of training is not that advanced though. I still haven't developed the ability to have strong orgasms without ejaculating, which is really the goal.

USER : BradP

HM I know what you're talking about. I can do the orgasm without ejaculating sometimes. It is an awesome feeling. And gives you super control and stamina. I should check out that book. I am turning 30 in August, but I think my body is not like normal 30 yo due to the fact that I've never drank 1 drink of alcohol, done drugs and I've worked out quite a bit. I think that slowed down the aging a bit for me. That's interesting about what the acupuncturist said. I have to say I'm often sceptical about anyone that tells you not to fuck, but this is kinda different cause they're saying not to ejaculate.

SEX FORUM : Dirty talk / Soft Insertion

Ok guys, I’ve only made one other post on the sex board, I’ve acquired some new skills and I’d like to share them with you. First off I’d like to say a few words about dirty talking. I was really self conscious about that kind of stuff at first, I’m sure everyone has worried about feeling weird doing it. I’ve slowly been getting into it my past 4 or 5 lays and I think I have it down. My results? Women LOVE it.

For example, dry humping through jeans I just started saying "mmmm, my dick is right on your pussy, it’s only an inch away from slam the clit with boner....sliding in". Just proceed to say dirty shit, tell her how bad you want to stick your cock inside of her pussy, tell her everything you want to do to her....and more importantly...what you ARE going to do with her. When she wants you to finger her or something, make her talk dirty before you give it to her, just to get her participating as well. Example: Mmmmm, fuck me "mmmm, I will but first you gotta say brimstone, I want your fucking cock, stick it inside of my pussy RIGHT NOW".

Make sure to tell her to say something you KNOW she is feeling/wants.

I posted in here previously about this girl, I just cannot make her cum. I've eaten her out and fingered her for 30

Rubbing her lips doesn't do it. G-spot and deep spot don't do it. Licking, caressing the general area doesn't do it.

She can make herself cum, but it takes her like 20 minutes...

Is there something drastic I can try? Are there finger or tongue exercises?

David. Shade's. Manual.

TALK to her. Engage the biggest sex organ she has, by one or two orders of magnitude: her BRAIN.

USER : James888

I would love to try that. Clearly this girl is capable of an orgasm, I just can't give one to her.

David Shade's shit is WAY out there, though, and the scripts aren't real -- say it wrong and it'll come off as stupid, not hypnotic or seductive. I can't picture myself trying to convince her she has a penis that's ejaculating.

Is there a happy medium I could EASE into the waters with? Some more down to earth scripts? A LR or even a book where someone describes in detail how they used Shade material to arouse a girl?

I usually don't say much during sex.

Have you actually TRIED talking to her?

Have you ever said to her, in a seductive voice, as you ran your hands over her body, "That feels GOOOOOD?”

How about "You like that?”

And, while I have your attention, answer me these questions.

Have you, yes or no, actually read David Shade’s Manual?

Assuming for the moment that the answer is "yes", the second question is: Have you ever, yes or no, actually TRIED something from the Manual with your

girlfriend?

Yes, I've done this. What she's told me is that (of all the stuff I've tried saying to her), the thing that has helped the most has been when I quietly told her to "relaxxxxx". It's hard to judge what works and what doesn't, since she's extremely non-vocal. When she masturbates with me (usually her rubbing her clit, me rubbing her g-spot), she makes barely any noises up until there's a little whimper when she comes. I can kind of tell what works by her breathing, and an involuntary twitch here and there, though.

How about "You like that."?

As a question? I've asked this a bunch of times: "do you like that?" Almost always the response is "do YOU like that?" Or did you mean as a statement.

And, while I have your attention, answer me these questions.

Most but not all. I actually bought it since it came so highly recommended...

Assuming for the moment that the answer is "yes", the second question is: Have you ever, yes or no, actually TRIED something from the Manual with your girlfriend?

Yes - I've tried the deep-spot, and I've tried sort of narrating sex. I didn't really get any reaction from the deep spot (though maybe I just didn't see the right signs -- see above). And narrating sex didn't do anything either.

Here's about what I said to her...

"That feels good, doesn't it? Real good. Can you feel your hips grinding your clit against my finger? That feels amazing. I'm going to touch you in a way that's going to send shivers up your spine. Are you ready? ... There, you like that, it feels incredible"

How's that? If it's okay, I still have a problem, it's hard to keep that up for 30 minutes without sounding like a broken record. That's why I'm looking for something more prescriptive than Shade.

The manual is like totally disconnected. On the one side, you have chapters on how you need to psychologically seduce women, build a mood, use their brain. And on the other side you have his actual hypnosis scripts, which are WAY out there. I'm looking for just some BASIC techniques.

It may be liberating for her if you would enjoy yourself. I'm not a sex expert in any, but I have had girlfriends who were really turned on by me being turned on.

There's a difference between asking 'do you like that?' as a means of seeking validation and to ask it to fine tune your actions.

Ok, so you need to go back and read the part on making her cum on command. My bf who is a pua does this it is awesome he can make me cum without even touching me. He can make me cum in all kinds of public place.

Pg 152





like one time we were at a cute little club with a group of his friends he made me come seriously in 2 min!!!

Here I will tell you a little bit about how it works for me. While having sex he starts probably about 3-4 min into it.

BF: are you going to cum for me baby?(sweetly)

ME: no (means yes at this point)

BF: are you going to cum for me baby?

ME: yes or no (either way it is a yes)

BF: cum for me baby!! ( a little bit aggressive)

BF: cum for me like a good little girl ( more aggressive very demanding) I literally start cumming. he asks me are you going to cum for me baby usually about ten times he can tell when I am really into it. He keeps saying good girl in a demanding voice and then he slowly starts lowering his voice letting me stop cumming. He started "programming" me from the first time we had sex and I didn’t even know!!!

Does your girl have a high sex drive? anyways read it again and try to work on this slowly be more aggressive!

ADVANCED FORUM : Sexual Banter

USER : lifeguard

All of this stuff is field-tested and been in use since high school (which is about 20 years ago) so yeah this shit works if you do it right. Brings up my next point of why it’s in Advanced (since there are many questions as to which post belong in this board): You need to do this at the right time to make it work. You can’t just dive in and start saying all this shit. OK, let’s go….

Sexual Banter. One of my secret weapons to getting girls in a sexual state because let’s face it, we, as guys, are always in a sexual state (except when I am on this forum cos that would be weird..) You see, when I am socializing at night, I like to come at women with a sexual vibe. You aren’t going to see me saying stuff like:

“omigawd..you are such a dork!” or treating her like my bratty little sister because that doesn’t create the sexual vibe I am going for.

That’s not to say it doesn’t work for some people (no diss intended) but it’s not my style, and it’s not congruent to the frank sexual talk I am getting to further down in this post.

First, a little background on how this became a tool in my arsenal. Back in high school, we had a crew of guys that used to hang out and go to all of the parties. After a many drinks, we would sit around and try to figure out how to get the women horny enough to want to fuck around. We already had the social status, we had the rapport, they knew we were cool and were attracted to us but how can we get them to fuck? Talk about sex! We would sit around and just throw out questions, make statements, etc.

So I took these tactics to college and even in the corporate world (for the time I was there). Yes, I know that that is wrong and I advise against it but it still works. Just don’t do it if you want to keep your jobs.

What I have found is that initiating sex talk is best after you have gained attraction and have built some type of rapport. You don’t necessarily have to have a connection or chemistry yet because the sex talk will help and create the right frame and lead to it.

OK, now that you have the setup, what do you say? I will give some examples. Let’s say you are sitting around with a few of your friends and a few girls. Maybe you’re at a VIP table getting bottle service or at a dive bar sitting around at some wooden tables (doesn’t matter), everybody is just kinda fluff talking, vibing, we are all comfortable, etc. I’ll just say something loud to the group in general: “OK, let’s cut to the chase, who’s getting some good sex lately?”

Pg 153

Or:

“I’m gonna jump right in with the sex questions…” This is a great one because the worst you’ll get is a few giggles and some naughty stares. Just point to one and say: “Aaah…your blushing. I thought I saw you walking funny. What’s the story?” Her friends will chime in and say something to bust her, and bang you are in conversation.

Even better is when you say the initial statement, some girls will boldly tell you that they are having great sex, and this is where you go to work. Some of these statements upcoming may seem AFC or supplicating but they ain’t, trust me. You already have attraction, rapport—you can slightly lower your value by seeming to be real interested while you pump up their sexual temperature. The girls are putting themselves “out there” by ‘fessing this shit up (even though they ain’t---they FUCKIN LOVE IT!!) If you don’t believe girls talk about sex like this, you haven’t been around many girls or aren’t friends with many girls. Believe me, they are PERVERTS.

Even corporate types and housewives. Watch “Sex and the City”. Young girls..forget about it, they are all over this shit.

OK, getting back to what I was saying before, the ones who willing volunteer to tell you about sex, I’ll say:

“Oh..we have a live one here. Let me guess: when you’re with a guy you like a big cock, right?”

“Yes…” she’ll say

“Does it hurt?”

“No…”

“Beautiful!” I’ll say. “Do you like it slow, fast, does it depend on your mood?”

Here’s one I use when I have isolated one girl:

“OK, can we talk about any sex stories or are you shy?”

“No…we can.” She says

“OK, weirdest place you ever had sex?”

“Blah..blah….how about you?” she says back.

This is where you got to have something good. I’ll tell my story about the Mile High Club or banging a girl in a dark corner of my college library, etc. (I got a lot of them…)

Here’s one I use when I am with a girl who is small:

“You’re a spinner, you know that?”

“What’s a spinner? She says

“Oh,,, it’s a good thing. It’s a term for petite women. You can get on top and guys can just spin you around.”

“Omigod….” She feigns embarrassment. This means SHE LIKES. SHE WANTS MORE.

“You like it being on top?”

“Yes…” she says

“Cool…do you bend back a bit or do you just straight up and down pile drive that shit?”

Now here’s probably my favourite sex talk set up:

“Got a boyfriend?”

“No.” she says

“What about a girlfriend?” I reply.

“Yes…” she teases

“Shut up! You like chicks? So do I. That’s so hot. We have something in common. Dude, you wanna pick up chicks with me some night this week? You like blondes?”

“Yes..” she says

“Unbelievable how much alike we are!” I say. “Ever have a 3 way?”

“Yes..” she say

“ So do you guys go out and pick up other girls’ guys?”

Pg 154

“Blah…blah…yes” she says

“ So you guys go up and say: ‘you wanna come home with us and fuck? No way! That’s fuckin crazy. Nice!”

Then I’ll say: “How about toys? You guys use a strap on?” or you could ask: “What’s it like one orgasm and you’re done, or do you guys trade off…how does that work?”

Then there’s a different route with a similar question:

“What’s the deal—you have a boyfriend, girlfriend, fuckbuddies—what?”

“I like guys.” She says

“Guys? What are girls too much drama? Dicks over chicks. Cool…my kinda girl.”

She giggles. Then I’ll say: “So what are you out for tonight—find a boyfriend or just get laid?”

“Get laid” she’ll joke if she’s cool

“Well…I’ve been known to help women in this area. Has that tongue ring been rewarding for the guys you’ve been with?”

“Yeah..guys like it..blah..blah” she says

“Do you like to suck cock? You can do a lot with that mouth. That looks like a mouth that can give good head.

Can you Deep Throat?”

“Yeah..sometimes.” she says “but I don’t swallow.”

“Yeah, you don’t swallow but you’ll scratch the shit out of a guy’s back!” I say Then there’s noticing body parts on them you like.

I’ll say: “Mind if I just talk to you and stare at your tits? I’ll bet everyone else does. Do guys stare at your boobs a lot?”

“Haha…yes.” She says

“What are those C’s…D’s?”

“They’re C’s.” she says

“No way..those are D’s. I have probably seen more tits than you have.”

Or if you’re an ass man, you can say:

“Yo….check out that bubble ass. That some ghetto booty there, girl. Turn around, let me check it out…stop fuckin around.”

She’ll act all shy but girls LOVE to think they have a nice high round booty, even if they don’t really. Then I’ll say: “How about being spanked? You like that? (slap her ass) No? How about pulling hair? (pull her hair) Yeah..it’s an aphrodisiac, right? You like it, I can tell. How about biting?” (bite her) I have literally a hundred different ways to open a sex conversation so I can’t list all of them but here’s some more random ones:

“Have you ever film yourself having sex?”

“When was the last time you had sex?”

To a Latina: “Do you speak dirty Spanish when having sex? Let’s hear some …”

“Favorite position? Cool…how about when you’re with another girl?”

“When it comes to anal sex—have you tried it, do you like it? Need alcohol with that? I understand.”

Here’s a game that I actually used during a six week corporate training program for a sales job. At night, we were sequestered together in a hotel. We were all in my suite drinking when I brought up this game that I knew from college called “Have You Ever…” You ask a question to the group and instead of answering “yes”, you just take a sip of your drink. So you start off light, asking “Have you ever cheated on your boyfriend?” etc.

Then it gets raw: “Have you ever had sex for money?” (some girl answered ‘yes’…haha!) or “Have you ever had a threesome?” You get the idea. This somehow led to ‘who would you have sex with in this training class if you had to?’ The hottest chick there said “Lifeguard”. I gotta admit, I was a bit surprised at the time but I pounded the shit out of her for the entire time I was there. She had some chump boyfriend back home.

Pg 155





So here’s a quick summary of some of the guidelines: 1. You have to make the girl(s) feel comfortable with you first. I have tried it other ways but it doesn’t work as well.

2. Do not hide your sexual desire.

3. It’s your reaction and them talking about it that turns them on. This is NOT a time to feign disinterest (not a big fan of that anyway but…)

4. Take a seemingly meaningless or innocent comment by the girl and attach a sexual innuendo to it. For example, she’s looking at a beer or something and says: “Look how big that is!” Then I’ll say: “If I had a dollar for every time I heard that…”

5. If you get ASD or bitchy looks or comments, call it out. Don’t let it hang there. If you do it right, it won’t happen, or at worst, one girl will do it. Then you just do it with the other girls until she gives in, which she will when she realizes it’s “OK”.

6. Work in kino while you are doing this. See my post in this forum called "How I Kino" for some ideas.

In closing, this has been a very, very successful technique for me. I attribute a lot of ONS to it (gee…I hope that doesn’t make me shallow…lol) What a lot of guys don’t know is that girls love to talk about sex and HAVE

SEX just as much as we do…even more, the horny sluts…haha. Who am I to deny them the pleasure. I am just sent here as a messenger to tell everyone else. The best part of the sexual talk, other than the hot, sweaty ape sex you get that night, is that sooooo many girls tell me after that, they cannot believe that they told me all that stuff after only knowing me a short time. They are happy someone has unlocked it for them. Amen.

4. Emotion


35m:10


Emotion is Bobby’s favourite variable in the PAVE system. He doesn’t always want to be a Bad boy!

He’s not an asshole or jerk. He likes the girl he’s with, he’s not a Bad boy, more from a nerdy background!!!

He’s not a wild and reckless crazy dude.

Even though sometimes he needs to act like that for good sex it’s not really him. He’s more like an emotional guy and he really likes his girl, she’s the one for him.

Emotion is the Key to Great sex

35m:55

Both of you have to feel strong emotions otherwise ….

For example when a woman masturbates with her toy, it is an emotional fantasy for her rather than about the physical stimulation. Think of women’s romance novel sex scenes, they eat this stuff up.

It doesn’t have to be make sense so long as it is emotional!

It’s kind of like an under the radar trick. It really turns the woman on and gives her a lot of orgasms. It’s not about a huge cock – not so much about physical stimulation.

Pg 156

The stronger the Emotions the better

37m:13

The sex is the best and (most importantly) the relationship is the best when you create strong emotions in your woman during sex. Woman can go buy a sex toy if that’s just what they really wanted.

Strong emotion creates the strong connection.

For the most part sex in a relationship is recommended (be it open or committed) as it is better than when with a one night stand

What has happened to Bobby a couple of times when having sex : he’ll have sex with his girlfriend and then literally 20 minutes later he’ll get a text message, “Hey baby I miss you so much.” This happens because the sex was so emotional, not because he has a huge cock. The sensation of longing and wanting to be with him is created by the strong emotions he creates within her during sex.

He’s not narrating amazing fantasies to her that nobody else can do. You can just use the scripts that they offer with their phone coaching.

So create strong emotions. If you’re going to be a Bad boy – don’t be only half committed to being a Bad boy.

If you want to be a Romantic – same thing – commit to it, don’t say your “lines” half-heartedly or go through the motions.

Saying “I love you”

Be careful when saying “I love you.” Don’t say it too early on in the relationship even if that’s how you feel.

You want the woman to say it FIRST. She may try to get you to say it first to get what she wants which is have you commit to a relationship with her.

You must be Verbal in bed

41m:01

Being verbal doesn’t mean talking about shit like, “so did you make dinner for tomorrow night.”

That’s not emotional and furthermore sex must be all about sex. Don’t talk about random stuff. Talk dirty or talk emotionally.

Emotions can fall into two categories : Romance/Emotional talk v.s.

Dirty/Authoritative talk

Combining the Dirty talk & Emotional talk is the ultimate in creating emotions because all of a sudden you’re Romantic and you’re being the Bad boy at the same time – makes women go nuts Say (sexual) things that you mean

42m:16

Really mean what you say.

Don’t talk about taking out the trash when having sex.

Examples of emotional Romantic talk

42m:40

You can talk about how much she loves you :

“Baby I can tell you love me.”

Pg 157





OR you can talk about how much you really love her :

“Baby I really love you.”

Examples of emotional Dirty talk

42m:46

Talk about how much you want her :

“Baby I really love being inside of you.” A great line and very low risk, you’ll never get rejected using this.

Or you can say, “How much do you like me inside you?”

Shawna likes being called a whore, a slut

It goes with women's natural instinct to be submissive, to be dominated An (extreme) example of hers, when she went to visit a guy she was dating : When he opened the door, straight away he said to her, "do not step in unless you're totally okay with me being dominant tonight, because I'm tying you down, then I'm doing this to you ... and this …"

Although this was totally inappropriate, it turned her on and she said , "well let me in right now."

How to start off with Dirty Talk

28m:27

The previous example is an extreme example of a really experienced guy, but you have to work up to that point.

Some girls might really be offended at being called a slut or whore.

So to be sure, be physically dominant with her first then be verbally dominant after that.

Some things you can say

29m:54

Ask her, "do you like it rough?" It’s a basic question

Ask her during a makeout session

Ask her, "how do you like it?" because each girl is different and you need to know When's the right time to introduce Dirty talk into your sex life?

When you're alone at home

You don't want her to feel like she's your little bitch, by talking dirty in front of other people. There's a difference between humiliation and dominance.

chapter 6 the sounds of sex

The sounds of sex are what this book is all about. The sounds of sex are recognized as the gunpowder in the bullet, the lightning to the rod, the natural Viagra to the body. What sounds do we love? What words do we want to hear?

What is the turn-on? We know how important, even essential, it is to make sex talk an intricate part of the passionate experience. Let’s start with some practice. However silly or unnecessary it may seem to you, ask yourself these questions and take part in these exercises.

Pg 159





Sex Sounds Questions

1.What sounds do you make during sex?

2.What sounds would you like to make?

3.What sounds would you like your partner to make?

4.What music do you like to hear when making love?

Sex Sounds Exercises

You may find these exercises may turn you on. Sounds can do that. Our physiology is very responsive to aural stimulation. Although the female is more responsive to words and sounds than the male, both are stimulated and pleasured by words and sounds. Watch your own body as you take part in these exercises. Please don’t be a voyeur to these words. Take action. Make the sounds mentioned. Hear your own interpretation of the moan, the groan, or the scream.

Do you like how you sound? Do you emote with these sounds as you make love? Do you want to add any of these sounds to your passion? Listen to the sound and watch how your body responds. I know you will be amazed to feel your physiological responses as you vocalize the various tones, pitches, and inflections. Some sounds may seem silly and make you laugh. Other sounds will actually stimulate your libido, and others will make you feel very seductive. As Nike says, “Just do it.” Watch the results.

Moan

Listen to how it sounds. Does it sound the way you want it to sound? Practice. Moan a bit throatier. Moan a bit longer. Moan a bit lower. Does your own moan turn you on?

Sigh

There are literally thousands of possible tones to a sigh. How is your sigh? Is it deep and relaxed? Does it say,

“I feel great”? Does it say, “Do it more”? Does it say, “Yes, yes, yes”?

Growl

Yes, growl. Let the animal in you escape and propel you to wilder and more carnal experiences. Send out a message with your growl. What does it say? Practice until you have several various growls stating pleasure, need, completion, primitive and uncivilized passion.

Purr

Imagine the first touch, the first lick, the first moment when you begin the voyage to passion and pleasure. How good it is. What fabulous expectations. What exquisite moments to come. Purr to express the feelings within your body. Say it with a purr. “Ohhhh yes, what a time we’re having.”

Squeal

There are moments when nothing expresses the feeling like a squeal. The touch so incendiary, the flame so hot, the feeling needs a totally infantile and uninhibited sound—a squeal. When did your body feel the need to release with a squeal? Try it now, it’s regressive, infantile, and indescribably delicious.

Scream

There are orgasms, promises, moments of such intensity that only a scream can express the feeling. Try to scream without the high pitch or unpleasantness often associated with screams. Screams have a bad reputation because too often there is a discordant quality to screams. She may be in the throes of ecstasy and release a scream that, unfortunately, pierces his eardrum or is so unpleasant a pitch as to turn him off. I know it is difficult to control your sounds when passion is the impetus and the mind has nothing to do with your behaviour. Practicing a scream can help to tone it down and make it a turn-on all of the time. Scream from your belly, not your throat. Scream with joy and appreciation. Scream whenever you feel it, and remember that you’re lucky to feel it, so don’t hold back—let it go.

Pg 160





Shout

It is more common for men to shout than women. The shout is a deep-throated scream, but is usually vocalized for the same motivations as the scream. There are Whoopees and Wohohos. There are Whoopdedoos, Howdydoodees, as well as Me Tarzans. Shouts are music to our ears because they tell us how magnificent and fabulous the moment is. So shout to let your partner know exactly how wonderful you feel.

Deep Breathing

The sounds of breath entering the lungs and leaving the lungs are very stimulating. The air entering and exiting, again and again, is relaxing. The slow, deep, breathy sound is not only a turn-on to your partner, it is a turn-on to you as well. Deep breathing is so relaxing that the entire body responds with an intensified sensitivity. When you breathe deeply, you can concentrate on the touch, the feel, and the smell of sex. Deep breathing and the breathy sounds of it enhance and provoke deeper feelings and more intensified passion. Breathe deeply into your genitals. Watch the breath stimulate your erogenous areas. Use your breath for enhancing the pleasure for both of you.

Hum

Put your lips against an ear, a nipple, a labia, or a penis and hum. The vibrations from your mouth will stir the juices and the sounds of the hum will stir the brain (our most powerful sex organ). Hum into a belly button or an anus. Hum under the arm, or inside the elbow or knee. Hum loud and long, and watch the blood stir and the flames ignite.

Laughter

Yes, I know laughter is very tricky. If it’s at the wrong time, in the wrong tone, or for the wrong reason, it can be disastrous. But laughter to express delight, to express fun, to express how joyful you are feeling is not only a compliment, it is an affirmation of the happiness you experience with each other. Laugh. It feels good and it conveys a very

positive message.

Silence

The sounds of silence are often as powerful as the sounds of sex. There are moments so intense, so stirring, when the body is so sensitized and highly charged, you can only be silent. You are merged with each other in a connection so deep, there is no consciousness, no thought, no sound. There is only the physical—the flow of blood, the beating of hearts, the tingling of skin. There is only the sexual expression of your bodies, entwined and seamlessly connected. There is silence. And then there is release with the sounds of sex, a harmony of sounds.

The Words She Loves to Hear

I asked one hundred women what words or expressions they love to hear when they are making love. The following are their responses. Are your favourite expressions included? If not, what are they? Add your own favourites before you share the list with your lover.

 I love you.

 I love touching you.

 You are so beautiful.

 I love your body.

 I need you.

 I love kissing you.

 I can’t wait.

 I’ve been dreaming of this all day.

 Do it to me.

Pg 161





 Give me more.

 You are so hot.

 I can’t stop touching you.

 I never get enough of you.

She loves “dirty” talk too:

 Your cunt is sooo hot.

 I love how juicy you are.

 Your cunt is delicious.

 I love eating you.

 I want to suck your tits.

 Your tits are gorgeous.

 Your tits are delicious.

 I love fucking you.

 Give me more juice.

 I want to make you cum again and again.

 I love how you suck.

 I love what you’re doing.

 I love your ass.

Do these words turn you on? Would you like your man to say these things to you while making love? What else would you like to hear? Share your likes and dislikes with your lover.

The Words He Loves to Hear

 You drive me crazy.

 I’m cummming, I’m cummming.

 Fuck me.

 Suck me.

 I love your body.

 What a great ass.

 It’s sooo goood.

 Give it to me.

 Now, baby, now.

 Take me.

 I’m all yours.

 You do me so good.

 I want you so much.

 You fill me up.

 You are so hard.

 You are so delicious.

 Kiss me.

 Lick my tits.

 Here they are, all yours.

 Here I am, all yours.

 Do it baby, do it.

 Give me the slide.

 Give me the up-top.

 Give me the ride.

 Give me the hop-hop.

Pg 162





 Give me the roll-a-round.

 Give me the big lick. •

 Give me the big boy.

Many men I spoke with really get turned on when their sexual techniques are given nicknames such as these.

Use your imagination as to what these mean and pick your own names for your various favourite positions and techniques. You’ll enjoy asking for these “specials” with a breathy, needy, urgent sound.

What We Don’t Want to Hear

You’re The Best!

What’s wrong with this? Everyone wants to be the best. But when you’re making love there is a danger of feeling that you are being compared to someone else. Even though the comparison is favourable, it still can be troubling and that’s not what you want.

Try saying something like:

 “You make me happier and happier,” or,

 “Every loving moment with you is better and better,” or

 “I love how excited you get me. You get me crazier and crazier every time.”

In other words, your comparisons and compliments are based exclusively on the lover you are with at the moment, without a remote possibility that your words reflect another lover or another experience.

I Don’t Like It.

Oh, no. Please don’t tell your lover you don’t like something, certainly not when you’re in the throes of passion.

Imagine being in a state of absolute ecstasy and fire and you hear the insulting words, “I don’t like that.” What a come down. Of course if you don’t like something, tell your lover about it at an appropriate time. Discuss it during one of your discussions out of the bedroom, when you have a contract to discuss an important issue, and when you are both agreeing to be respectful and loving, not angry and hurtful.

“I don’t like that,” when expressed in the heat of the moment, is denigrating and very disrespectful. If your lover is trying to please you, accept it for the moment. If a touch or a movement or a behaviour is so distasteful to you that you truly can’t abide it, try a distraction—move your body a bit, begin to kiss lips, or stroke hair, or massage the neck. Do whatever is necessary, but don’t say you don’t like it.

Do It This Way!

When you’re in the moment, remember the subtleties of sex talk before you begin issuing instructions. If you want her to suck harder, don’t just say, “Harder, harder.” You might whisper, in a breathy, deep voice, “I love how hard you suck me.” This is both a compliment and a challenge. She will, of course, want to suck even harder when you tell her how much you love her hard sucking. If you want him to go faster, use the same technique. In a passionate voice with a seductive tone, tell him how much you love how hard he is and how fast and hard he fucks you. You may say, “I love your hard cock, I love your fast cock, I love you.”

These are very touchy moments. On one hand, you want it the way you want it, when you want it. On the other hand, you don’t want to demean or insult or turn off your lover. Be sensitive. Don’t give orders. It is best to suggest, imply, challenge, tease, seduce, and succeed. You may want to be subtle and move your own body more quickly, or closer, or away, or whatever it takes to put yourself in the position you want. You may want to move his hand, or her leg, or your face. Be loving and respectful at all times. Be hot and horny and needy, but don’t be demanding or authoritative. Be giving and responsive and passionate and watch your satisfaction soar.

Pg 163

Asking

It almost goes without saying that you should never ask questions such as: “Did you like it?” “Was it good for you?” “Did the earth move?” “Was I the best?” “Am I a good lover?” It is a turnoff for many reasons. First of all, it is true that if you have to ask, maybe it wasn’t very good. When passion is glorious and electrifying and earth-rockingly magnificent, you don’t have to ask. You know it, you feel it.

When you are secure as a lover, it manifests itself in how you make love and in how satisfying the lovemaking is for both of you. If you are secure in this you never ask. If you are insecure, you always ask. Become more secure with the ideas and techniques in sex talk. Become more secure within yourself as you enjoy and pleasure and excite yourself and your lover. Become more aware of the do’s and the don’ts, and you won’t have to ask.

This is also true of silly questions like: “Did I take care of you?” “Am I a good Mommy?” “Am I a good Daddy?” “Did I feed my baby goooood?” “Does my baby feel good?” This type of question only serves to separate you from your real identity. You are not a daddy or a mommy or a baby. The experience is of two adults, not of an infantilized man and woman. Use your own names and your own identities, not a false veil to mask your own fears or insecurities or embarrassment. Of course, you may have nicknames for each other. It is a fact that the more nicknames we have, the closer and more loving we seem to be. But, unless mommy or daddy or baby are your special private names, you’re better off leaving them alone.

I’m Not In the Mood, I Changed My Mind.

Imagine being in the arms of your lover. You’re kissing, you’re touching, your juices are flowing, and you hear,

“I’m not in the mood.” Nobody wants to hear these words. I suggest that, even if you’re truly not in the mood, you don’t say a word. Your body will take over if you allow it. Let the touching, kissing, and caressing put you in the mood. Remember that passion and sexual desire is a physiological response to a variety of cues. Allow the stimulation to turn you on, and your “bad mood” may very well be turned off. If you suddenly think of a chore you need to do, or a word he said that you didn’t like, or that she insulted your mother this afternoon, your response may be to withdraw. But don’t do it. Pouring cold water on your hot body would be less painful than hearing, “I’m not in the mood.”

What is it that you don’t want to hear? What words or sounds or behaviours are painful to you? Share helpful suggestions when the timing, the agreement, and the situation are appropriate. When you are having a cup of coffee, touching each other’s hands, looking into each other’s eyes, and agreeing to discuss these issues, talk about it. Tell your lover what she said that you felt badly about. Tell your lover what he said that hurt your feelings. It is best to discuss these issues some place other than in bed, and certainly sometime other than when the heat of passion is making you vulnerable. Share your thoughts with your lover at an appropriate moment, not during your lovemaking or during a sensitive moment.

Sounds and words are reflective of our feelings, needs, and satisfactions. Sounds and words enhance the moment. You create sensations and motivations that would not be experienced without sounds and words. Sex talk is a turn-on because the body actually does respond physiologically, not just emotionally. Sex talk is a turn-on because the mind needs the reassurance, impetus, and motivation to perpetuate passion and lust.

Sex talk is a necessity for all of these reasons, and because it is fun. Sounds and words are exciting and pleasurable and fun. Sex talk is a necessity because we are thinking, feeling, intelligent humans who use language to express ourselves. What better way to create the sensations we want and need and enjoy than to express these feelings with words and sounds? Don’t miss out on the treasure chest within your voice box. Use the words and the sounds that will get you what you want, when you want it, and how you want it. Use sex talk with love and respect and joy. The benefits are all yours.

Dirty Talk

When you do this process to a woman, you become the prize. And women will work themselves into a frenzy to get the prize and that’s - and you use that. Now giver her two or three days and give her the opportunity to come out with you again and you give her the same process. But what I do - there’s a few other things that I actually do when I’m conditioning woman. I do a lot of - I don’t do any hypnotic commands in a sense that I, you know, I try to bind them to me but everything that I do is hypnotic in the fact that I’m always pacing their ongoing experience, which - like if I’m gonna talk dirty - my whole way of talking dirty to a woman is to tell her exactly - describe with a woman exactly what I’m doing as I’m doing it. It creates a tremendous, tremendous report and incredible suggestibility and it amplifies their sexual feelings.

Seminar 5 – 4/16 – Stamina & Positions

58m:40s How to add to Great Sex

 Have covered many technical points up until now, now we’re going to discuss how to turn sex into great sex using the energy components that’ll really add to a woman’s pleasure 61m:40s Dirty talk

 For women making love is so pleasurable on a physical level and they love the intimacy that gets created with a guy. It’s the only time when the guy lets down his defences, gets really close to the woman and shows a lot of affection. Women absolutely love this, they love the intimacy and connection that they feel with the man when that occurs. Now the things that we’re going to discuss may not on the surface seem like it adds to the intimacy, but taking a closer look can actually pull you closer together and that includes dirty talk. This is because sex is a very private and intimate realm we share with very few people and there are places we may not feel like we can be loved. A lot of woman have mental pictures about being a whore, about liking sex too much and being called a slut because of that. However all of us can express all things, so when a woman feels like she can be loved as a slut and whore, that she can let that aspect out and not be judged and actually be loved for it, then she’s going to totally let loose.

63m:25s Every person wants to be loved at their lowest

 So what it’s really about is allowing the other person to love us past our idiosyncrasies. This applies to a man as well. A man might be insecure about his penis size, how much money he makes, his physique and looks. Although men usually put up a lot of shells and protection he also wants a woman who’ll love him at his lowest. For a woman to love him even though his penis is small whatever the standard is. To love him even though he even though he doesn’t have much money, even if he has a pot belly. For a Pg 165

woman to love him with his whole being, for who he be’s in the world, his vision for the world, his purpose, the way he be’s. For her to love him through all that

 This is the same as man who loves her thorough all her sexual expressions and emotional outbursts, through all the things that may or may not be pretty. To feel like she can relax into who she is, because at the core we all want to be loved just for ourselves. To be chosen fully 100% just for ourselves. So when we can have a person who we admire and adore, who we think is hot and gorgeous and amazing with an amazing personality who thinks the same about us, then that is absolute heaven. Regardless of everything else we talk about, that’s the level of energy we’re trying to create

 A lot of us overcompensate for this by going to the sexual technique, by going to varying sexual positions, by making ourselves almost invulnerable. Yet it is the vulnerable part that we most yearn to be loved for. It is in opening our self, in revealing these part to another that we get the satisfaction that is the depth of what sexuality has to offer. This is Neo’s vision for us

65m:50s Dirty talk brings you closer. Requires a confident secure man

 So the reason why dirty talk can bring two people closer is because when you’re talking dirty to her i.e.

calling her a slut or horny, things that from a general societal point of view are negative. However really you’re making it okay. ‘Yeah I see this aspect of you and I love it. I love the fact that you have so much sexual energy and that you ask to have your ass probed. That is so sexy.’

 It takes a man who’s really confident in himself because what happens often, is that the women who get called sluts and whores, are usually being called that by men who aren’t getting any or can’t satisfy that woman! So basically as a defence men will call women that name, so he doesn’t have to point fingers at himself for not being able to satiate that woman, for not living up to par or for not even getting any. So it’s a loop where the woman rejects the man and the man rejects the woman, when they really want to get it on really well

67m:11s Compliments

 Dirty talk doesn’t just have to be calling people names. It can also be complimenting i.e. ‘I love the way your amazing soft velvety pussy feels against my tongue”. So you’re describing to her the ‘taboo’ part of sexuality you’re experiencing with each other. “My God it’s so hot when you show me your ass as you bend down for me”. Basically you’re just telling her what you like and she can see the same thing, it’s like ‘oh my God’, or ‘oh Daddy, fuck me hard.’ All these taboo arenas that you forage into, make sex so much hotter because you couldn’t even share this intimately with any another person, maybe not even your closest guy friend, except your most intimate partner. It’s very vulnerable and that’s why dirty talk can really add to this

68m:23s Appreciation

 Another way to amplify and deepen your connection is through appreciation. You can just tell her what part of her body you love the most about her, it may be she has amazing breasts. Women never tire of hearing how amazing they are, how beautiful you think she is, how succulent her nipples are. They’ll never get tired of this

 Choose a woman who’s at least an 8 for you. Although here is no definitive perfect woman, there is the perfect woman for you so choose her so you don’t have to fake it. You’re naturally inspired to work through the difficult times. Tell her how you love the way her hair feels in your fingers and that level of appreciation will turn her on and open her more than you can know. It’ll really amplify the amount of sexual and sensual pleasure you experience with her and really open her orgasmic potential

 Appreciate her any time you can. Tell her how much you adore and love her

69m:49s Sexual amplification

 Every time Neo’s lover is getting close to another orgasm and Neo tells her how much he adores her, her whole body opens and the degree to which her sexual energy gets amplified is insane.

Pg 166





 Amplify her response any way you can. One of Neo’s past lovers called him up about a movie she’d seen that was about bondage and she said to him that’s what she wants. Yet she’s the most innocent joyful fairy type woman but she wants to open and explore this realm with him. So Neo said to her he’s going to buy a paddle with a heart shape on it, so it’ll leave a heart shaped marks and it was very hot.

70m:55s Fantasies

 So talk about what amplifies your sexuality with each other, like fantasies for example. If you’ve never asked your woman what her fantasies are, then do so. You don’t necessarily have to act it out in person, use words to pretend that you’re there, although outfits totally add to it.

 If her fantasy is to be playing with another woman or guy and you’re confident enough in your sexuality and who you are as a man then you can pretend to be you and that other guy. You can even switch your voice when you’re the ‘other’ guy taking her from behind and she can’t see him, your mannerisms are totally different and you’re pretending to be a big football player for example

 Give her the fantasy she desires. If she wants to be fucked by 3 other guys, you can be all 3 of them and she’ll have the most amazing sex ever because you’re changing personality and playing with that

 You could both be nerds discovering each other. Some women have rape fantasies when she feels safe enough o explore that with you and she wants feel your power in being able to take her

 When you’re playing with fantasies create safety words like the colour red or whatever. So you push the edge of where she wants you to take her unless she says the safety word. The realm that you’re going to be able to explore and the amount of opening that she’s going to have from this, is going to blow your mind. If she wasn’t able to have ejaculatory orgasm before, maybe she needs to trust you on a deeper level before she can open up to that level with you

 So ask her what her fantasies are. Tell her what your fantasies are. It’s through these incremental steps of deeper trust that the two of you are going to co-create the most amazing sexual experience possible.

It’s through these incremental steps of being comfortable with almost anything, that there’s nothing in the shadows that you aren’t comfortable with each other. You may not approve of certain things but you accept them in each other , that you’re going to be able to give each other the love at the core that each other deserves and craves for. When you can fulfil women to that degree the amount of pleasure, sexual openings and orgasms will be at a totally different level

REVOLUTIONARY SEX - ALEX ALLMAN

Part 3 : Talking

I assume you already know how to talk… this chapter is about the specific art of talking DURING sex and foreplay. Not unlike anal sex, some people like it, and some people don’t. For some women, talking can be an unwelcome distraction from the deeper forms of communication that you are sharing in bed. (Just because you are not talking does not mean that she does not crave powerful non-verbal communication). But for other women, talking is the single largest turn-on in bed and will do more to get her excited than your knowledge of her g-spot coordinates or the size and endurance of your cock. In case this is not incredibly obvious, you never want to talk about anything non-sexual in bed. Bringing up what you did today at work while having sex will get you kicked out of bed. But even talking about sex in any kind of insecure or pleading manner will kill her mood.

So what kinds of things should you talk about in bed?

Tell Her What You Want

What do you really wish a woman would do for you in bed?

Pg 167

Think about it for a moment. What would be the hottest thing she could do to turn you on… would you like to see her finger herself? Do you want to come on her face? Do you want her to spread her ass cheeks while you are fucking her from behind? Is the thing you want her to do common… or shocking?

Now that you’ve got that image in your mind… of what you really want a woman to do for you, my next question is: Have you ever just come out and told a woman to do that thing for you when you were in bed with her?

If the answer is “no,” then I’ve got some interesting news for you…

She would have LOVED it if you had.

If you are shaking your head right now, HOLD ON A SECOND…

You might be saying to yourself right now, “but I DID ask her to do it, and she refused.”

So let’s look at the question again. Did you TELL her what you wanted? Because that’s not remotely the same thing as ASKING her.

Let’s be honest here, your idea of fun may not match up with hers. You may get off on the idea of having her pee on you, and she may be disgusted by it. Probably, if you tell her what you want, she will not comply.

But more often than not, the thing you want her to do will be something that she will either be very excited by, or at least willing to try.

And more importantly, if you TELL her what you want, and you do it with calm authority and a confident tone, even if she does not want to do it… she will STILL BE TURNED ON by your masculine sexuality.

I’m not necessarily saying to “tell her what to do,” in terms of ordering her to fulfil your desire… though that may often be a good thing and will usually turn her on. But just telling her, without shame, straightforward, exactly what you want is a dominant and masculine way of sharing your sexuality with her.

Some women are very sexually dominant. For some women that might mean just being the one in control, the one leading the fuck and deciding when you change positions, what the pace and rhythm is, telling you what to do… or even, I suppose, the Dominatrix with her leather outfit and the whip, spanking some guy’s ass and ordering him to lick her boots…

But the vast MAJORITY of women are sexually feminine and submissive… even women who are extremely competitive, competent, dominant, and strong in their real, daily lives very seldom want to be dominant in the bedroom.

If you run into a sexually dominant woman, she will not like it when you tell her what to do. She’ll respect it, it may even turn her on (though, maybe not), but she will not comply because she will feel competitive with you and won’t want to give up her power.

This is very, very uncommon.

Most women, because they have a feminine nature, are very aroused by men with a masculine nature.

When you TELL them exactly what you want, it shows not only dominance, but decisiveness, confidence, and self-knowledge. Whether you get what you want or not, it will definitely increase the sexual tension and excitement of the situation.

Pg 168





I’ll say it again because I want to get this into your head: Even though it may be something that she is not particularly turned on by, the fact that you TALKED about it so openly, affirmatively, and confidently will give her a little rush of sexual arousal. She will probably just go ahead and do it. And enjoy it.

But even if she says “no,” she will be blushing and squirming at the idea of being told what to do to please you.

She may even say, “I don’t want to do that, but tell me what else you want.”

This is the beginning of being verbally dominant, which MOST (but not all) women will find very erotic.

It’s important not to confuse verbal dominance with verbal abuse.

Some women will be turned on by verbal abuse, but that is for the chapter on “ROLE PLAYING.” You NEVER want to be authentically abusive.

But it is good to cultivate some authentic dominance.

If you are ever wondering what to say to a woman in bed, this is a great place to start: Tell her exactly what you want her to do.

Talking Dirty

Telling a woman what you want her to do sexually when you are in bed with her is not necessarily talking dirty.

After all… you are in bed… the conversation of what you want in bed is completely appropriate.

But it CAN be dirty depending on the way you say it.

Talking dirty basically involves using a lot of 4letter words. Words that we have been told since we were children are wrong, forbidden, or bad.

And for some women, “wrong, forbidden, or bad” is very, very sexually exciting.

Talking dirty can be an art, and some people are just astonishingly good at it. Others can be very uncomfortable and stilted when trying to add in all of those 4letter words that they are uncomfortable with.

If you’re interested in trying out talking dirty to a woman, you might even consider practicing. This sounds funny, but… try it in the mirror and see if you can do it without hesitating to think (or cracking up).

All you have to do is add in the words cunt, cock, fuck, bitch, slut, pussy, etc. into whatever you are saying.

The more the better.

Now I’ve got to tell you that while some women get very turned on by dirty talk, others just tolerate it and they’ll get into it if they see that it turns YOU on… but still many women just really HATE it and get very turned OFF by it… or even offended.

How do you find out if a woman likes dirty talk or not?

Well, you could ask her… but you should NEVER ask her in bed!

If you are having drinks some time and discussing sex, it’s completely okay to ask her if she is turned on by dirty talk in bed. You’ll probably get an honest answer.

Pg 169





But if you ask her in bed, it would not be a masculine way to communicate in a sexual environment. It would make her feel that you are tentative, and it would be a turn off.

If you are in bed with a woman and you want to find out if she likes dirty talk, you’ve got to just say a few dirty things and…

PAY ATTENTION.

If she likes it, you’ll know.

Sweet Whispering

Whispering romantic and sweet things into a woman’s ear while making love to her is nearly a sure thing…

But like anything else, some women don’t like it.

The most common situation where a woman will not appreciate sweet whispering is if you just met her in a bar two hours ago and she was looking for hot sex and dirty talk. For her, the idea that you are saying sweet things when you hardly even know her feels inauthentic.

But most women will absolutely love it… especially during foreplay, after play, and the early stages of sex when you are still leading up to her first orgasm.

She will completely melt if you do it well.

Sweet whispering is also an art and it’s a shame that so many guys are uncomfortable with it. But if you are like most men, it is something that you can become good at with a little bit of practice.

For an idea of the EXACT sorts of things that women love to hear, try thumbing through a few women’s romance novels.

A lot of the dialogue in those books will sound absolutely ridiculous to you. And it WOULD be ridiculous if you said any of those things in a restaurant or on the sidewalk. But somehow, when you say them in bed, they just make a differen t kind of sense.

If you want to just improvise on your own, then remember that the most important thing will be your tone. If you whisper softy and deeply into a woman’s ear while stroking her hair, you could recite the alphabet and she’d probably get turned on.

Instead of the alphabet, however, try just telling her exactly how she is making you feel. Or describe to her, in vivid detail, how her skin feels or how her hair smells, or how much you enjoy touching her.

Use a lot of adjectives and descriptions. Not just that her hair smells good—but what does it smell like? What does the smell remind you of? How does it make you feel?

If you filled in those blanks and came up with, “your hair reminds me of a warm, safe place where as a child I’d hide…”

Congratulations, you are Axel Rose and think up poetry that drives millions of women wild.

But if you whisper, “your hair smells like the spring time—it makes me feel like we’re making love in a meadow full of flowers…” Well, my friend, I’ll think you’ll do very well with that one too.

Pg 170





Want something more advanced? Build a scene for her. Say, “I’d like to make love to you in a…” and then describe the setting in deep detail and describe exactly what she is doing, what you are doing, and how it feels.

This is the beginning of sharing fantasy, a subject that I’ll talk about in a later chapter.

Sex Communication During Sex

Dirty Talk

Speaking of how does that feel"?, that simple question and its answer can also be the beginning of a less informational and more down-and-dirty dialogue during sex. It's all in the way you say it. Erotic talk doesn't have to be "dirty" per se—it can be sweet, sensual, and romantic, or it can be bold, nasty, and raunchy.

Whichever way you say it, dirty talk can heighten a sexual experience and really drive both of you over the edge.

Most people are interested in dabbling in some hot conversation, but don't know how to start the fire. The easiest way to begin is to describe what's going on. This may seem like simply stating the obvious, but you'd be surprised at how much of a turn-on the most basic sex talk can be. Frank sexual descriptions are not usually part of everyday discussion, so "saying it loud" can be titillating, provocative, and even a little naughty.

Especially if you put it in such a way that it sounds breathy, passionate, or downright nasty.

For example: 'You're so wet. I've got my dick inside that wet hole of yours and it feels great." Talk about what you are doing, what you are going to do, what you want to do. Like: "Honey, put my cock in your mouth. I really want to feel your lips around me." Tease, tempt, torment a little: "I'm gonna lick your pussy and get you all worked up and leave you here all turned on with no release. Do you want it? Do you?" Ask for what you want, beg for what you need: "I'm gonna go crazy if you don't put your fingers in my ass right now. Please . . ."

Some people like to actually spin out a whole story or scenario to complement what's going on physically. Tell an erotic story, share a fantasy about what you were thinking about doing to your partner all day while at work, describe something you saw in an erotic video, and how you'd like to try it with your partner.

Sexy talk takes practice, and it's probably best for beginners to start simple. Fear, embarrassment, or shyness can prevent you from opening your mouth in the first place. Reassure yourself and your partner that it's safe to talk, and no one will be criticized or chastised for what comes out of their mouth. You also need to test the waters with your partner about just how raunchy you can get (and this might be a good thing to bring up before you open your mouth).

For some, words like "cunt" and "slut" are a total turn-on, while for others, those same words seem vulgar and defeat the purpose of arousal altogether. Don't force dirty talk, let it flow out of your mouth as naturally as juice flows from a pussy. Say what's on your mind; honesty can be the hottest thing around. Once you get into it, let your inhibitions go. You'll be talking up a storm in no time!

Of course, straight talk and dirty talk are not mutually exclusive. You can create your own dialogue which both instructs and arouses, or you can move back and forth between giving straight information and whispering nasty little thoughts. You can stick to one, then the next time try the other. Change your tone of voice ever so slightly, Pg 171





and go from nice to naughty in ten seconds flat. Whatever the case, give yourself permission and plenty of space to open your mouth and speak your mind. You might just be surprised what comes out.

Dirty Talk Tips

Describe:

The simple act of narrating your sexual encounter can be sexier than you may think.

Instruct:

Some people not only appreciate being told what to do it turns them on. Get in touch with your inner dominatrix, and dole out an order or two.

Be naughty:

Think of the wildest stuff you've always wanted to say and go for it. Channel your inner bad boy or bad girl

Beg:

Desperation is normally not very sexy, but when you are desperate for your partner to do something, a little begging can go a long way

Be outrageous:

Let your inhibitions go, and let the sexual banter flow! Be bold and bawdy, let your mind wander and your mouth follow

Tease:

This can be an incredibly effective verbal turn-on. Tell her what you're going to do to her, then make her wait.

Couple your words with a few suggestive touches, and you'll whip her into a frenzy

Tell a Story:

Now is your chance to create that erotic story you've been dreaming about or put you and your lover in a porn-movie encounter.

Talking after Sex

As you recover from orgasm, lying together sweaty and sticky, you may or may not feel much like talking. But there is a reason that secret agents are debriefed after an important mission. Having as much information as possible puts them in a powerful position. When your mission is great sex, you too need a debriefing session.

Perhaps the afterglow of lovemaking is not the best time for one. Wait a little while and bring it up when you both have the time and energy to talk about it. I don't mean for you to overanalyze each of your sex sessions or process them blow-by-blow every single time. But shortly after fucking is a good time to talk about fucking. It's a great way to be specific while the details of the encounter are still fresh in both your minds.

You can talk about what turned you on, what felt really good, what you could do without next time, what you'd like more of, what could go on a little longer (hint, hint), something that surprised you, something you thought of during sex, something you'd like to try next time. You can use these examples in the form of questions in order to gather information about your partner's feelings about your sex life.

For example: What turned you on? What would you like more of ? And so on. Sometimes people who are shy about talking explicitly about sex respond better to specific questions, rather than the old, "So how was it for you?" To which the tight-lipped will often respond, "Fine," which doesn't give you much to go on. Probe as gently as possible for more information by asking specific questions: "Did you like it when I sucked your cock like that?" "When I am licking your pussy, do you want me to put a few fingers inside you?" In general, be generous and caring when you communicate with your partner. When you want to bring up something you don't Pg 172





like, remember: compliments always feel good—criticism does not. If you want to tell her about something you didn't like, why not start that conversation with something you did like? Make sure to talk about what wasn't pleasurable as well as what was pleasurable. The more you talk about it, the easier it will get. Trust me.

SECRETS OF A SUPERSEXPERT - TRACEY COX

Chapter Four: Pushing It

The Other Oral Sex

How do I tell my lover what I’d like without offending them? I want to talk dirty but what the hell do I say?

They’re two of the questions I’m asked the most often—and, guess what? The answers, and everything you always wanted to know about sex talk, are right here.

When you’re shagging yourselves silly in the early days of your relationship, talking about sex is easy. In fact, most of us don’t shut up about it. We’re all smug and self-congratulatory about how naughty we are, how hot the other person is, how our friends are jealous that we can’t keep our hands off each other, blah, blah, blah. It’s only when things go wrong that we clam up. Not so much fun talking about sex when you’re not up for it, not having it, or don’t enjoy doing it.

But here’s the deal: if you can’t talk about sex with your partner, you aren’t going to be having it long-term. Kid yourself all you want that the odd grunt, groan, or moan is all you need to communicate lust. That the six-year sex rut you’re in will just fix itself with time. That your husband’s wandering eye has nothing to do with the fact that you haven’t slept with him for a year. That your wife’s yoga lesson really does go on till 10pm. That if you concentrate hard enough, he’ll finally figure out where your clitoris is. Dream on. Talking about sex doesn’t just fix these problems, it reassures us, deepens trust, and makes us feel “normal.” It creates desire, titillates, and—

most importantly of all—stops us sliding into the perilously tedious, God-do-we-really-have-to sexual doldrums.

With so many advantages to talking about sex, why don’t we do it? Because if you choose the wrong words, the opposite can happen. You can just as easily upset, deflate, and devastate your partner, destroying what little sex life you had left. No wonder we’re all so nervous about opening up to each other. Now I’ve really got your attention, let’s look at how you and your partner can open the channels of communication—and inject some seriously spicy sex into your life.

Start talking

Good things to say and try

 Do you like it when I do it here/ hard/soft/like this/like that?

 I love licking you.

 Which way do you like it best— like this or that?

 Your ass is so divine. Do you want me to spank it?

 Do you want me to put a finger inside you?

 Can I kiss you here?

If you don’t ask, you don’t get …

 If you want to talk dirty but can’t bring yourself to, make a tape or leave voicemail on their cell phone (never, ever leave it on their answer machine at home— we’ve all seen the sitcoms), write a sexy email, send a text or instant message, leave a note in their pocket or wallet, hell, write a message on the mirror in the steam from the shower. Or call them at work when you know they can’t answer back and tell them exactly what you’ve got planned for that night. “Just thought you’d like to know I’m masturbating right now because I can’t wait to be inside you later,” then hang up.

Pg 173

Talking dirty

Just like before, set some ground rules to find out what would turn both of you on.

Have the chat

 What sort of language do you want to use? Set limits if one of you doesn’t like slang or swear words.

(Be careful with emotionally charged phrases like “You’re a dirty slut.” Some women love it because it’s so politically incorrect, others find it insulting.)

 When should you do it? Just before orgasm or to get you in the mood? What about if she whispered in your ear in public?

 What sort of themes? (You’re a slut, you’re a virgin, you’re a goddess). Do you want a beginning, middle, and end to it—more a fantasy than dirty talk?

 How do you want it? Do you want it soft and sexy, low and sinister, forceful and disrespectful? Do you want them to say stuff, but for you not to answer?

 Do you want to pretend you’re other people? Some people love pretending their partner’s “sleeping”

with someone else, others get jealous, which destroys the mood in two minutes flat, and leads to discussions like “This is about John, isn’t it! He’s got blonde hair and bulging muscles. You’re fantasizing about him!”

Now do it

 Pitch your voice lower than usual. If you’re shy, whisper in their ear so there’s no eye contact or try blindfolding them, or letting them blindfold you.

 Keep it simple to start. Describe what he’s doing to you. “You’ve got your hands on my breasts.”

Add what that makes you feel, “... And it feels wonderful.”

 Describe what you’re doing or about to do. “I’m going to take your penis in my mouth and suck it.”

Add what that makes you feel—“… And it makes me feel powerful. Like you’re in my control.”

 Compliment body parts. Tell your partner “I love your muscles,” or “You’ve got the best ass I’ve ever seen.” Pause, draw back, and let your eyes totally devour what’s in front of you, then look them straight in the eye and say “You’re beautiful. I want you so much.” Talk about how good you are together—

“God, I so love our sex together.”

 Encourage dirty talk. Ask “Do you like that?”, “What does it feel like?”, “Do you want more?”, “What would you like me to do to you now? I’ll do anything ...”

 Let them know where you’re at arousal-wise.“Ummm, this is starting to feel really nice”, or “God, I’m so close to coming.”

 Let her know how much you want to please her, “I’m going to make you come so hard, you won’t know what’s happened.”

 Let him know how good he looks—“I love watching your face when you come.” Give a blow-by-blow description—“Your tongue feels amazing. That’s just amazing. Keep doing it. Don’t stop.”

 Read aloud something sexy from a book or a magazine while your partner works on you.

 Pay attention to body language. Just because your partner isn’t saying anything or is coyly refusing to look you in the eye, doesn’t mean they’re not enjoying it! Is he getting harder? Is she getting wetter? Are they breathing harder? You’re doing fine, so keep going.

 Give cunningly disguised direction. “Use that gorgeous wet tongue to lick me right there. Really soft.

Get it really wet. Swish it around. Just like that.”

Why talking dirty

Again, it’s so, so easy in the beginning. You’d eyeball them suggestively and ask them to do things Angelina Jolie would have blushed at. (That’s back in the Billy Bob days rather than Mother Teresa reinvent.) It’s later, when you’re mates, that it just starts to feel wrong somehow. Incestuous. You’re not alone—it’s normal to feel more embarrassed talking dirty as time goes on, rather than the reverse. But, like most things in sex, all you need to fix it is to actually start doing it again—and challenge any negative thoughts.

Pg 174





It’s taboo

Parents who taught us sex was “bad,” religious beliefs, a past lover who branded you “unladylike”

(read slutty)—all make us nervous about speaking up. Beat it. Tell your partner why it’s hard for you to talk dirty and that you need to take baby steps. Give yourself permission—parents don’t know everything, you can be spiritual and still have great sex, your past lover had serious issues. Try saying naughty things out loud to yourself first. Practice in front of a mirror at first.

You’re scared you’ll laugh

Yes you will. Talking dirty is funny. That’s why you have to do it when you’re both turned on because the second you’ve climaxed, whatever you or your partner just said seems either hilarious or really perverted. So don’t freak out when it happens, just keep going.

You don’t know what to say

Some women love screaming obscenities at the top of their voice and don’t care if the neighbours change lines at the supermarket checkout. Others don’t like slang and swear words and that’s OK! Whispering

“I want you. Now” can be just as erotic (to some men, more so!). So don’t try to be something you’re not.

On the other hand, if your partner shoots through the roof if you use “dirty” words, indulge them. Come up with some compromises: he wants you to use the nasty “C” word, you don’t. How about “pussy”? Come on, that’s the word you call your cat!

Talk Dirty to Me:

He or she may say a picture is worth a thousand words, but in the bedroom the sound of a lover's voice can turn us on, bring us closer together, and charge our sex lives with a new element of fantasy and communication.

Imagine the power the sound of your lover's voice has over the telephone when you're separated by distance, and then imagine that voice, stripped raw in the passion of the moment, telling you all the naughty, beautiful or emotional things you've always wanted to hear. We get goose bumps just thinking about it!

Sex is about all five senses, but too often we forget about the audible needs of our lovers. While it's natural and easy to touch, taste, smell and see each other during lovemaking, you have to make a conscious effort to really sexually satisfy the sense of hearing. And sex is, as we all know, as much about the mind as it is about the body.

Bringing an element of speaking to your partner during lovemaking can arouse his or her mind more quickly and powerfully than anything else, bringing out sides of him or her in bed that you may not have seen before!

If you've never experimented with turning your lover on with your voice, we recommend trying it. But there are some things you should keep in mind! Try to get a sense for how far your partner will be comfortable with your taking the dirty talk. In particular, while many women love being talked to with a naughty tone in bed, many surveys report that women also tend to be more self-conscious when men praise their bodies or actions during sex.

To help you out with this, we've suggested four different levels of dirty talk below, so you can ease into this practice and get comfortable along the way. Also, and most importantly, do not rehearse what you are planning to say to your lover in bed! Nothing is going to be more of an instant turnoff (to most people) than if you sound like a rehearsed porn film! We're not denying that for some couples, roleplaying that you are adult film stars is a great turn-on, but for most people, much of the arousal factor in talking dirty is the spontaneity of it. Let your fantasies come out of your mouth naturally. Let go of your inhibitions and trust that the person you're with is going to be just as turned on by your honesty as you are!

Pg 175





Talking Dirty to Turn On Your Lover vs. Sharing Intimate Thoughts Just so we're clear here, "I want you to touch me here because it makes me hot" is talking dirty to turn on your lover. "I love you so much it hurts me every minute I'm away from you" is sharing an intimate thought in bed.

Both of these techniques can enhance your lovemaking. The decision on which to use really depends on both your partner and the effect you're going for.

Talking dirty to turn on your lover often results in wilder sex that revolves a little more around fantasy. Sharing intimate thoughts can make your sex more impassioned and emotional. Talking dirty to turn on your partner is a good way to show and tell each other what you've been wanting the other to do in bed, while sharing intimate thoughts can be a great tool for telling each other how much you care, without many of the inhibitions of daily life. Just remember, the power of something said in bed is only as strong as the actions you use to back it up the next morning! Don't tell your lover you can't imagine being away from him or her for a minute if you're planning to rush out the door at first light to go golfing or shopping. While talking and speaking to each other during lovemaking can enhance communication and sex, you shouldn't say anything you wouldn't be willing to repeat with the lights on.

How Brave Are You? Four Steps to Being an Accomplished Dirty Talker!

So you're ready to break the silence barrier in bed? Perhaps, however, you' re not sure how your partner will react to it, or you're not sure you're ready to be brave enough to tackle the task! Try phasing yourself in by starting with the lightest step below and working your way up to Phase Four.

Phase One: Read Some Erotica Out Loud

There's nothing safer to start with than using somebody else's words. If you're not ready to tell your partner your fantasies yourself, invest in an erotic book and try reading your lover a story at bedtime. We'd suggest getting a collection of stories like The Erotic Edge or Delta of Venus. Both of these books are proven classics, and if you read through the stories you'll probably find one that describes a fantasy you have! Try reading that one out loud and seeing how your partner responds. If your partner enjoys the erotic reading (before bedtime is always best!), let him or her take the book and pick out the next story he or she'd like to have read to them. You may even want to set the mood with some candles and wine to create a more seductive atmosphere. Eventually, you may even want to work up to writing your own erotica and reading it out loud to each other!

Phase Two: The Naughty Call at Work

So you're ready to really tell your lover what you want to do to him or her, but you're scared you'll blush and ruin the whole thing? Why do you think telephones were invented? Yes, we all know that millions of telemarketing companies across the nation think they were invented just to interrupt you at dinnertime, but in reality telephones were designed to be an erotic tool! Imagine your lover sitting at his or her desk, in the middle of the day, counting down the hours until 5:00 pm. Instead, you call, and while you tell your lover what you're planning to do to him or her and where you're planning to touch them when they get home, your sweetie has to sit there pretending to care about his or her computer screen! Some tips for the perfect erotic phone call:

 Don't call right before lunch! Hunger pains and sexy talk sometimes don't mix well.

 Try describing, step by step, the sex you're fantasizing about having with him or her later.

 If you're really naughty, describe to your lover what you're doing to yourself while you talk to him or her on the phone (and we don't mean tell them about how you're cleaning the plaque off your teeth!)

 Turn off the TV or radio! Your lover will not find it sexy if Ricki Lake is talking in the background while you're describing what you want to do with your mouth. You should actually make sure any extraneous background sounds are gone, and no matter what you do, don't run the vacuum or cook a meal in the microwave while you're talking dirty on the phone! You want to build up a fantasy, not get your lover thinking that you're running around the house in sweatpants while cleaning the refrigerator.

Pg 176





 Don't make promises you're not going to keep! Don't tell your lover on the phone that you want to do something to him or her when you know you'll never actually want to do that! That's not fair, and called teasing!

 Finally, you'll talk sexier if you feel sexy. Put on some music or wear something that makes you feel good about yourself.

Phase Three: Praise Your Partner's Body

If you've made it through the first two phases, or you're just sure your lover is ready for you to start talking dirty, it's time to bring your voice into the bedroom (or wherever you and your partner like to play). But take it slow -- if your partner isn't used to hearing your voice during sex, it might be best to start out with complimenting him or her to get them relaxed and comfortable with this new sexual element. Tell him or her how much you love their various body parts, their eyes, the way your partner looks at you when you make love, and the way he or she smells. Praise all the things about him or her you really do love, and praise those body parts while caressing or kissing them. Remember, though, there's always the chance that this will make your partner self conscious, so stay aware. Pay attention to how your partner is reacting. Is he or she responding and getting excited or are they giggling and seeming uncomfortable? If he or she seems to be responding well, you should definitely keep going, but if you're not sure, it never hurts to ask them. A simple question like, "Do you like what I'm saying to you or do you want me to stop?" whispered into your partner's ear can not only show him or her that you're concerned about making sure they enjoy the experience and are relaxed, but also lets you know if you're on the right track. Chances are your lover will be flattered and aroused by what's coming out of your mouth.

Phase Four: Let's Get Naughty

Okay, this is the big one, to be tried only when you're sure your partner is ready for it. This is when you start talking dirty. One note, by the way: when you're talking about sexual acts with your partner in bed, you should use the words that will really turn you both on. If more hardcore words for sexual acts get you going, use those.

But if softer descriptions are more comfortable, stick to those. There are four ways to go here: What I'm Going To Do:

This is a popular one. In this dirty talk scenario, you tell your lover what you're going to do to his or her body before you do it, for example, "Now I'm going to gently bite your neck." This allows them to anticipate what's coming next, and this technique works even better if you have him or her close their eyes while you do it.

What I Am Doing to You Now:

Just another variation of the above, but with this one, instead of giving your lover warning, you simply verbally state what you're doing. You'd be surprised how much more erotic licking your partner is when you're saying what you're doing at the same time.

What I'd Like You to Do:

What's the easiest way to get your partner to tell you what he or she wants in bed? Ask them. "Tell me how you like it," or "Tell me what you want me to do to you," will open the door to your partner telling you what he or she wants, and with any luck you'll grow from there to having them tell you without your asking.

How You're Making Me Feel:

Sometimes knowing that you're reacting to what's going on in the bedroom can make your lover even more aroused. Start with the simple, "You make me feel so good," or "You feel so good to me," and work up from there.

The most important thing to remember with talking dirty is that it's supposed to be comfortable and exciting for both parties. Pay attention to how your partner is responding to you (you should always be doing that anyway!), and you'll know how far to take it. Forget about silence being golden -- a little talking can be orgasmic!

How To Get Her To Masturbate on The Phone – David Wygant

Khiem and I are walking right now with Yakub, and we're hanging out and doing what we call a "brainstorm day" – well actually they both goofed off on some weird internet sites for a little while which they didn't share with me – but they downloaded things to my Mac which sort of scares me a little bit, but at least I'll have some fun entertainment when I get home…

But we were all hiking and talking, and they were asking me, "What are the secrets of how to get her to masturbate for you on the telephone?"

Now, I've been somebody who has absolutely enjoyed the benefits of phone sex – even before women got to enjoy the benefits of the Blackberry-vibrating phone sex! How to get a woman to masturbate for you on the phone is really very simple.

First, you have to call them late at night. Let's say you've been emailing this woman back and forth. You've been flirting in emails back and forth, and maybe you've had a couple of phone conversations, and she tells you she'll be around that night for you two to talk.

What you need to do in that email or text message is say, "how late can I call you? I want you to be really cozy and comfortable when I call, so you're not thinking anything about the day." So she'll tell you how late you can call.

So then you call her that late – 11 o'clock at night. She's in bed, she's wearing her little jammies, and you start conversing with her. You talk to her about emotions, about anything that has to do with a deep topic. Because remember – sex for a woman starts in her mind. You need to connect with her.

You can't get on the phone with her and say, "So what are you wearing right now? Do you want to masturbate with me on the phone?" No – it's about connecting.

Picture it as foreplay – or phone-play! What you need to do is just talk to her a little bit, get to know her a little bit, make a comment on something you guys have shared together – maybe this is like the first or second phone call, and you've learned things about her.

Maybe she's told you that she really loves deep conversations. You can say to her, "man, I really love deep conversations with you. I love to get to know you better, it's so much fun. I'm enjoying exploring you. I'm enjoying penetrating your mind." When you talk in very subliminal sexual ways, it will make her very sexually turned on.

Most guys make the biggest mistake: a woman is talking to you late at night, you're having an emotional conversation and you're connecting, and the guy will immediately ruin it by saying, "are you wet right now?" Or

"you know, my cock's hard, you want to feel it?

You don't want to say that! What you have to assume is that she's already turned on. What I like to do is use very subliminal language. "I'm having so much fun connecting with you now" – that's foreplay in her mind. "I'm having a great time learning about you." "Wow, I wish I was sitting right there with you right now, seeing your eyes during this conversation" – that's another thing to say to her.

Or when you are talking about something, there's a pause, and you both feel it – you need to get a bit more daring. Say, "did we just have a kiss moment?" and she'll say, "Well yeah, I think so!" Then you can say,

"Alright, let's play true confession. If I was there right now, what would you want to do?"

Pg 178

And then she'll tell you. If she feels comfortable, she'll say, "oh I really want to kiss you and touch you right now." You can say, "Touch me? I barely even know you! How do you know I'll even let you?" – you want to be playful a little bit.

Then she'll say, "Oh come on, what do you want to do?" And then you tell her.

What I always say, over and over again, is, "If I was there right now, I would look deep inside your eyes, I would kiss you, I would look at you, and I want to feel your energy. I want to look and see what I stir up inside you after I kiss you."

All of a sudden, she'll take a deep breath, and say, "really? Tell me more." So then you tell her more! "I'm a very passionate person, and I love to explore a woman's body – but only after I connect with her mind and her soul," and then describe what you'd love to do to her.

What I do is do it very subliminally: "right now, if you were standing in front of me, I would LOVE to look at you after I kissed you and see how hungry your eyes are. I'll know just by the look in your eyes how I want to proceed with your body – I'll know what I want to do next."

You're taking control at this point. You're painting a picture. Most men don't paint that picture – they paint a picture of weakness. You are basically telling her, "If I was there right now – this is what I would do to you."

Then, at that point, you have to judge her temperature. You can ask, "Well, do you want to hear more?" 99.9%

of the time, she's going to say of course! At this point, you want to be very subliminal in what you say to her.

You want to say things like, "after I'm done kissing you, I would take a look and I know your body would be talking to me, and I know exactly what I would do. I would start at your neck…" and describe it.

"I would start at your neck, because I want to taste your skin in my mouth." Use very explicit terminology: "I would then take my mouth and kiss every inch of your body, tasting every bit of you, and feeling your energy and the way you react" – use those terms. Not once do you ever say, "I want to spread your legs and lick you like an ice cream cone!" It's all very subliminal.

At this point, you tell a story – and it's all about how you tell that story – "man I would just take you, flip you over, and kiss your back from head to toe," and listen to the way that she is breathing. If she starts breathing a little bit heavier, or sighing a little bit – if she says, "tell me more" and her voice is getting very breathy, it might even seem like she's out of breath at this point. If she's having short little bursts of breath, and saying, "more, more more…"

Then you can say to her, "alright, if I was standing there, what would you do to me?" and allow her to describe it now. The thing about sex, and what a lot of men don't do because they don't understand how sexual women really are, is give women a chance to express their sexuality. Women are very sexual creatures.

You want to give women a chance to express their sexuality by saying, "tell me what you would do for me."

And let them tell you – and react to it! React positively. When she tells you the things she wants to do, say,

"god I love that." Encourage her a little bit more. A lot of times, her ex-boyfriend or ex-lover didn't allow her to do those things – she didn't feel that sexy around him.

The reason why she is exploring this with you over the safety of the phone is that she is trying to figure out who you are. She already has a fantasy about you in her head, so allow her to talk about that fantasy. And every time she says something great, say, "oh man, that is so hot," or, "wow, that would feel so good," or "I'm yours – you can do that!" And then just add some stuff to it so it becomes this conversation.

Pg 179





Then, at that point, when she is describing things, not only have you turned her on, but she's turning herself on –

you are allowing her to talk about her inner fantasies. At that point, you can say to her: "let me ask you now –

how wet are you?" She will say, "very." You then say, "I want you to feel yourself right now, and then describe to me how wet you are. Describe what it feels like in your fingers."

Many times she will say, "I've been touching myself the whole time!" You ask, "You've been touching yourself?" And then you take total control: "Really? I want you to touch yourself some more, and I want to hear you. I want to hear what you're fantasizing about right now. I want to hear your passion for me. I want to listen.

I'm going to talk you through this. I want to listen to what you are burning for right now…" and allow her to talk.

Keep asking her, "what are you doing?" and she'll tell you what she is doing! Encourage her: "oh, keep doing that, I want to hear you cum. Cum for me baby, come on." And then she'll ask you if you're touching yourself.

Whether or not you are watching ESPN or touching yourself is your own prerogative – but you say that you are touching yourself. Hopefully you are enjoying the phone sex, and actually having phone sex with her.

This is the way that you get a woman to have phone sex.

Not only that, but once you have phone sex with her, real sex is right around the corner. There is no waiting –

no games, no playing, NOTHING. Once they've played with you on the phone, they want to play with you in person. You have something to go on.

The next day you text her and say, "I'm going to make you beg tonight again – I'm going to make you beg!" and she'll say, "Oh please don't make me beg! When are we going to see each other?" And she's going to beg, because you've gotten inside her head.

You have gotten inside her mind, and you've gotten inside her soul, like most guys haven't done.

And that's how you have great phone sex!

My phone game … (pg 77)

Have phone sex with them if you can – Sorry guys… you are not getting this!!! But remember… your voice tone is essential when you are getting sexual on the phone and in person.

My phone game … (pg 79)

A few other things I would add are don’t be afraid to talk about sexual topics… (leap of faith Mikey?) Obviously you have just met this girl, so you need to start gentle and calibrate… (“What’s going on in your love life” OR “Are you a sexual person?”) Sex is a great topic… It helps her to start seeing you as the sexual ball of energy.

The more sexually charged chat will really help when it comes to Kino… You mentioned on the phone that you were looking to hold the hands with the girl ASAP. The hand to me is the most intimate part of the body to hold. I might hold hands in the club, but on a Day 2 off the street, that may be a little too far… (unless you feel 100% comfortable with it in which case it is fine). I always link her arm inside mine when I am walking with a girl… That way their bodies are totally pressed against yours… this seems like a more chilled out way to be constantly touching a girl.

Pg 180





My phone game … (pg 82)

There is something that I do that works well for me and also gives me 100% success in screwing girls in the mouth and the vagina on day 2's.

I use my phone as a day2... I chat to girls a lot... I text them and call them a lot. I overwhelm them and become a significant part of their life for a short period. I am always very sexual and rude and always steer the conversation towards sex... what I like, what they like and what I am going to do to them. I get to the point where I have built up so much familiarity, comfort and trust with a girl that the day2 is really just about meeting up for sex. I do this every single time... I get day2's at my house... and if they want a drink first, I always go to a bar near to my house so we can "go back to mine"... I tell them this. They know they're going to get drilled.

I ask girls if they fancy me. (they rarely say yes)

I ask them if they think we are going to have sex (they always say no).

I ask them about their underwear. "Do you have any black french knickers"

What underwear do they want me to wear? "I love tight black calvin kleins..."

I tell them I am like an STI.

"Come and get into my bed"

If I've kissed them, I will say "I've kissed you... I have put my tongue in your mouth... don't you ever forget that"

"I really want to kiss you now..."

"I want to see you."

"Do you think we will have good sex? "

"I need to have you soon".

I tell girls to try to resist me - I currently have 2 bets outstanding of £50 quid each that they will not be able to resist me. "If you get into my bed in just your black french knickers and I am in my black calvin kleins, you will not be able to stop yourself or stop me from having you... I bet you £50". They take the bet and therefore are guaranteeing me that they will be in my bed in their knickers. You think they are going to be able to stop me when we are almost totally naked in bed?? They say with such certainty "We will not sleep together"... and I just smile to myself and say something along the lines of: "I look forward to battling you very soon".

Guys don't say these things to girls... That is why they are such powerful things to say.

For me, using the phone in this way, cuts out a lot of the need for actually dating girls... you can chat them up from the other side of town and then just meet up and fuck them.

My phone game … (pg 90)

I tell them "stop seducing me"... "What are you doing to me I really want to kiss you right now"... "I want you in my bed right now". I am very very sexual with them. They seem to love this and what is more, I think they actually enjoy being seduced hard and fast by someone who can't seem to help himself. I overwhelm girls.

Getting farther on Day2's.... “Phone game” (pg 92)

Guys,

Normally, when you get a girls number, you call her, chat for a bit, arrange a meeting then go. When you get there, you have to them chat and get kino going and then kiss close. If she is high value, you go home and then arrange a day3 and then you meet her and maybe you fuck her... Blah blah blah.

Something that I do that always gets me from A to B quicker.

When I get a girls number, I spend a load of time with her on the phone... A lot of this time is spent talking about sexual topics. "I really want to kiss you" "What are you wearing?" "What's your best underwear?" "Do you like being pinned down and dominated" I tell them about my arms and my black boxer shorts" - I try to Pg 181





have phone sex with them if I can.

Girls need to be made to feel and in my experience, horniness is the best emotion you can give them. A man who can turn them on is a man that they will fuck (given the opportunity) Not only is this enjoyable, but it also get's girls very sexual. When you hook up on a day2 and the girl has been getting very sexual with you on the phone, how do you think she will behave? If I have spent the last 3 days telling her I want to kiss her, how hard do you think the kiss close is? If you have been openly sexual with her, do you think she will feel uncomfortable when you start hitting on her? Of course not... It is like taking candy from a strap-on.

My frame is that I am totally overcome with a desire to have sex with her. Like I am powerless to the emotions she is stirring up in me. When I am in bed with a girl, I will tell her "I don't want to have sex with you... I am just finding it really hard... I want you."

I took a girls number from Tesco's car park a few days ago. I started getting sexual with her on the phone. At first, she tried to tell me I was too forward and that she didn't want to see me. I carried on hammering her with non-sexual and then sexual conversation. I wore her down and then she began to reciprocate. By yesterday, this girl suggested coming over to mine. From the moment she was there, it was so easy... Kino, kissing, grinding.

(She wouldn't fuck me, but she did give me the best blowjob I have ever had.) I spent all day in bed with her and her big fake tits... I didn't realise how good fake tits were until yesterday... I don't think I will ever switch back now. ;D She was a solid 9. I am fighting back some really strong feelings towards her as she is one of those women who makes you ask yourself the question "Should I stick or twist?"

I have a lapdancer coming to see me this evening, so of course I will be twisting hard - I have got so sexual on the phone with her, she is making me meet her in the pub so she doesn't get into bed with me. I am really tired from Amsterdam this w/e, so there is no way we will be in a pub... we will be "watching" a DVD in my bedroom.

Guys... this advice is spot on... Get on your phones and gives these girls an experience before you hook up with them... Your day2's will become so much more fun...

Re: Sexual Texts (pg 93)

This all comes into the arena of using your phone to get women.. I am a massive advocate of using your phone to get girls. I simply can't see how guys can get the volume of women that we are all looking for without it. It is essential to my game.

I get girls into sexual texts and conversations the moment I talk to them. I always start with... "come and get into my bed." They always say "no"... but it doesn't matter what they say, because they are thinking about it.

"What are you wearing?" then "what underwear do you wear?" "Do you wear French knickers or thongs.... or Apple catchers?"

They always love talking about their underwear...

Don't listen when they tell you, you are too forward... it's logical bullshit.

A girl I met in Tesco's car park last week text me saying that I was "too forward" and she wants a guy with better "manners".

I called her yesterday and got this text "Baby Girl. Please give up! I told you that I was a fussy girl and I'm not going to meet someone so forward as you! Sorry! We're too different! Have a nice life!"

Pg 182





I had a 20 minute phone call with her last night while I was driving to a girl I met the night before. In the conversation, we were talking about her knickers, her ass, how she likes guys in tight black boxer shorts and guys with muscular legs.... I was telling her I wanted to get in her bed. Before I went to bed, I got this text "Just got out the bath and I am going to sleep as I am knackered but congrats, you've made me laugh so I've forgiven you for being crass and decided that we can share a bottle of vino together soon! Good comeback for a cheeky chap".

Unashamedly start making suggestive remarks from the outset. Some will play ball straight away... some will want to get more familiar with you. Calibrate... Don't tell a girl "I want to be in between your legs" if she got annoyed at your first suggestive comment. Carry on chatting to her and make a less forward comment later.

Every time you make a sexual comment, it sinks into their brain and they start fantasizing about it. Start slowly... "Come and get into my bed" and calibrate... if she takes it, then move forward and make more and more sexual comments.

I met a girl on Friday night - kissed her and got her number. I met up with her on Sunday night... I spoke to her for about an hour on Saturday... I called her about 12 times... I always call girls a large number of times on Sat and Sun. I got things very very sexual with her over the course of the day. "I told her I wanted her to use my body" By the time I met her last night, we destroyed each other. If I hadn't have started making things sexual, when I met her, it would have taken me time to get her into bed. I had done all my seduction on the phone and all I was doing was transporting my dick to her so she could suck it and then ride it.

This is a GREAT frame to have the entire time. They ultimate player who is consumed by sexual desire and then need to meet and fuck women all the time. Everything about my behavior in my entire life is congruent with this frame and it works.

Talking Dirty in general (pg 97)

Learn how to talk dirty when you are fucking her... It's really fucking good.

If you feel awkward, just start slowly and escalate it.

Start by making more noise...

then... "do you like that"

"do you like it when I fuck you like that"

"tell me how you want to be fucked"

"get down her... I want you to put it in your mouth".

"Suck my cock"

"turn around... I am going to fuck you from behind".

It's only weird in your own head... talking dirty is really good.. Think porno films...

Furniture Shopping and Oral Sex... “Sexual Tone” (pg 21)

Before we went shopping, we measured the dimensions of my room. One alcove is 47 inches across… I told her

“Or approximately the length of my penis”. Every time we looked at a piece of furniture and thought about dimensions, I would ask “shall I get my cock out?”

When we came to pay for the furniture, I mentioned that I wanted to go back to mine and measure the door ways again…

I told the assistant that the girl and I have “a very special tape measure”

Pg 183





The assistant (who was obviously not in on the joke) started cracking up and was kind of ribbing me saying

“what can it do magic tricks or something?”

Baby girl – “yes… yes it can… have you ever seen the seafood trick?”

My girl was cracking up… It was so on.

We went to Comet and I bought a plasma TV. I asked the assistant if they could mount it. Under my breath…

“she likes it when I mount her”. All three of us cracked up.

I was setting a sexual tone throughout. Keeping loads of Kino on.

We got back to mine and after a short while we got into bed and started kissing.

I escalated sexually… I am not going to go into details on here, but the techniques I have developed at this stage in the game were definitely the difference between getting a snog and getting sex. In actual fact I didn’t get sex because I didn’t have any condoms, but I could have had sex and the blow job was sensational… She was whacking my dick against her tits and staring straight into my face.

Anal Sex via Instant Messenger “Phone Escalation” (pg 45)

So... I pulled this girl from Leeds just under a year ago. She came to Brighton with some friends... I kissed her in the club and then met her the next day and did a few things with her including unloading all over her face.

Anyway... she went back to Leeds and I planned to go and see her to fuck her, but it never came to fruition.

I have spoken to her by email about half a dozen times in the last year. She came on MSN instant messenger for the first time about half an hour ago and this is the conversation we just had: Baby Girl says:

I thought this may be useful for some guys who are interested in sexual escalation - I usually talk about the same kind of things when I am trying to get a girl turned on. I also think it's quite funny that at 10.30am I was sat in my office with a hard-on, having internet anal-sex with this girl. I don't know if you can learn anything from this, or whether it's just an interesting read - let me know.

How To Talk Dirty To Your Lover

One thing I’ve been asked to write about – very often – is talking dirty. The kind of erotic talk that heats things up in bed – on the floor, over the kitchen sink – wherever.

I do understand the fascination with it. Hearing is of course one the five senses, and along with sight, touch, smell and taste, can add to the excitement and enjoyment of having sex. If you’re into it, dirty talk – and mind you I don’t think it’s dirty at all – can make good sex better, and great sex downright memorable.

In the classic porn film, "Talk Dirty To Me," starring the incomparable John Leslie, his dirty talk drives women absolutely wild. They’re out of control, fucking and sucking him, without really even knowing why. It turns them on so much that even though they don’t originally want him, they can’t help themselves. Does it really work this way? With the right people and done properly, I believe it can. So read on.

Before we get started, a quick mission statement. Why this article? Done right, talking dirty to your lover can be a powerful aphrodisiac. It can bring out hidden desires and fantasies in both men and women. It can be hot

– oh man, you have no idea how hot – and add an aspect to sex that kicks it up several notches. I promise. The rules are, there are no rules. But I have some suggestions and observations that can get you on the right track and get you going. After that, it’s up to you my friends. You don’t want me there as a coach…

What is dirty talk anyway? What is considered dirty? Is it, "mmm, that feels so good," or "get on your knees and suck my cock you whore." The answer is – both, depending on who’s talking and who’s listening. One person’s dirty is another’s mild. To yet another person, it’s downright perverted and filthy. This is important to keep in mind.

On one end of the spectrum, you have sex so silent that it could qualify for a covert operation behind enemy lines. I think there are some concrete reasons for this speechless sex. A) Either one or both of the parties feels uncomfortable or embarrassed about sex. B) Either one or both of the parties feels uncomfortable or embarrassed about any talking during sex because of upbringing, religious beliefs or what have you. C) There is a high level of inexperience. D) Nobody knows what to say or how to get started.

The remarkable thing about it, which always perplexes me, it that some of these men whose mouths are sewn shut during sex won’t stop talking during a sporting event. Their excitement is overwhelming. They yell, scream and jump up and down when a touchdown is scored or a home run hit. And some of the women just won’t get off the phone with their friends and family. But get them in bed – wham – you shut them right up.

The middle ground would consist of some moaning and groaning, perhaps a little, "yes" or "that feels good"

here and there. These people clearly enjoy sex, and may benefit from this article the most, but don’t want to or know how to take it to the next level.

The other end of the spectrum, God bless it, is when the lady expresses herself in a dignified manner such as, "I want to suck your cock like a ten dollar whore," and the man replies "That’s right, baby, I want to taste the juices flowing from your cunt." It’s hot, tasty, salty sex. My favourite kind, I’d like to add!

Any or all of these variations are fine, as long as the people involved are satisfied. And if you want to get on this train, if you’ve been looking for a way to add that extra ingredient to augment your sex life, read on.

Dodger’s manager Tommy Lasorda was once asked, "Did you ever think in your wildest dreams that you’d be in the World Series?" and replied "My wildest dreams have nothing to do with baseball." Well put.

The point is that if your girl asks you to "talk dirty" to them and you say, "Fuck me hard and long, I want to cum on your face, you slut," she may freak because what she expected to hear was "I can’t wait to be inside Pg 200

you." If she says "suck my cunt lips until I scream your name, I want to be your cock whore," he may be shocked, because to him, dirty is, "Do me, honey." In either case, expectation is far from reality and may be embarrassing enough to prevent either one from ever trying to talk dirty again.

Obviously, it would be better to have some idea of what the other person would like to hear before you say "I’m gonna spank your nasty ass ‘til you squeal like a pig" to a monastery candidate. Before you begin to talk dirty to your lover, ask yourself, what kind of a person are they? Are they easily offended by harsh language or do they swear like a truck driver (no offense)? Do they appear to be open minded in other ways, about oral sex or different positions for example? How do they like their sex? Fast, furious and balls to the walls, or slow and tender? This can at least give you some kind of gauge where to start experimenting.

Warning - do not judge a book by its cover. I’ve known some girls who were demure and seemingly innocent at work or school. But once the passions of desire had been stoked – they played with live ammo - pass the Vaseline, duct tape and batteries, we’re having a party!

If your adventures in talking dirty start with your lover asking you to do it, ask them what they have in mind, what they’d like you to say. If this is too embarrassing for them, ask them to write it down. I’ve always been more comfortable writing than saying it, too. I once knew a girl, wonder where she is now, who would leave me little notes in private places telling me what she wanted to do to me. It was a different kind of dirty talk, sure, but it got me fired up all right. More on that later.

You can always start out slow. No one expects to go from silence to waking the neighbors with your screams in just one night. It would seem too labored, too artificial as well. I believe it would be more natural to begin with light fare, such as "yeah, that feels really good." One of my absolute favorites is the simple, elegant and unfailingly hot, "Oh God." You don’t get an "Oh God" unless you’re doing really well. Maybe an "Oh,"

possibly an "Oh my," but when you get a nod to the Big Guy, you’re on the right track.

Once you start out slow and comfortable, see how that goes, where it takes you, and decide to move on or not. If you are the instigator, it usually follows that you begin the dirty talk, and your lover gets the idea. If they don’t, try asking them questions which will prompt a response, such as "How does that feel baby, is that good?"

Or, "Do you like it when I do that?" Again, if you like the idea of dirty talk and want to make it a regular part of your sexual behavior, it’s far better to start slow, even though you may want to blurt out, "Your cock is so big I feel like I’m being fucked by a horse," which I don’t hear often enough for some strange reason beyond my comprehension," or even, "spread those ass cheeks wide, doctor enema is coming in for a landing."

Outrageously dirty talk is wild fun, and can spice the hell out of a sexual liaison, but it can truly turn off the uninitiated, so be cautious at first.

Which brings me to another very important issue. What you do in the bedroom stays in the bedroom. It may be OK for you to call her ‘your slut whore’ when you’re fucking, or for her to call you her daddy (oh baby!), but not back I the real world. You do that and you’ll spoil your bedroom fun in the long run. Unless your lover likes it, leave it in bed. She may want to be treated like a naughty little girl who likes to be punished in bed, tied up, blindfolded, whip out the vibrator and…don’t get me started, but you should separate fantasy from reality.

Just to clarify a little further though, when I say keep it in bed, I mean keep it in the context of sexual situations. I once had a girlfriend who would write little notes on cocktail napkins when we were out to a fancy dinner, "When I get you home I’m going to suck your cock until you cum in my mouth." Waiter? Check please!

A buddy of mine leaves explicit letters to his wife, and calls her during the day to tell her where they are. By the time he gets home she’s ready to rock the Casbah. I know a young lady, and she knows who she is, who with one sentence on the computer keyboard can put a lump in my throat and my pants. I can’t see her face or hear her voice on the internet, but her desire comes through loud and clear. Yours can, too.

Pg 201

But I repeat, you can call her during the day and say "I miss my sweet little whore," or she can tell you she

"longs for her guy’s meaty cock down her throat," when you’re away on business and it’s all great fun and in the right spirit of sexuality and desire. Just keep in that way and in perspective. It definitely doesn’t have to be restricted to the bedroom, but there is still a time and place.

This also means of course that your lover knows you mean no disrespect in what you say or write. You may call her ‘your cum sucking cock hound’, but that’s only in the realm of sexual fun and fantasy. She probably doesn’t want you to think of her as a whore in the real world, so let her or him know you understand the difference.

I think it also should be said that dirty talk, like any other delicacy, can get old fast is overused. I love a good steak, but not every night or I’ll get sick of it. If you talk dirty and take it to the limit every time, it’ll lose its erotic value, which would be a shame. Perhaps it’s best to save it for those times when sex is the menu for the evening, instead of a quick appetizer or late night dessert.

OK, are you almost ready to get started? Great. Do keep one last thing in mind before we summarize. Tone of voice is all-important. Think of Minnie Mouse bellowing "Fuck me with your huge little mouse cock, Mickey!" in her squeaky little cartoon voice. Does that turn you on? If so, you may be related to Walt Disney.

You can’t use your daily student, motherly or business meeting voice. It may sound like you’re giving instructions. "Now stick that big cock or yours in me. You ready to cum? Good, then cum, I’ve got errands to do."

In your sexiest voice, shaking with desire and passion, say something like, "mmm…your cock feels so good inside of me…so warm…you making me…you’re gonna make me cum so hard…so hard, baby…" Or if you’re a guy, in your lowest, most measured tones it may be "Oh baby, you’re so beautiful…I just love to fuck you…to have my cock inside of you…I love to watch your face when it’s full of my cock…I’m so hard for you…"

Whatever the words. Whispered in her ear, they’re magic.

And unless you are in fact whispering in your lover’s ear, the best way to talk dirty to them is when looking into their eyes. The hottest, most erotic words will have little effect if you look away to say them, as though you’re shy or embarrassed about it. If you practically mumble them to the floor, you may not even be heard. Speak up – we’re all friends here! Look your lover in the eyes and tell them you love what they’re doing, or what you’re dying to do to them or have them do to you. Don’t be timid, be proud! Speak it, shout it, whisper it, but let them see and hear you. Can you imagine how hot it is when your lady’s face is near your cock as she looks up at you and says in her sexiest voice, "mmmm…I just love your cock…I’m gonna rub it all over my face and then tickle my tonsils with it…I’m gonna suck your cock until you beg me to let you cum…" This has got to add another inch to that erection! Two if she’s rubbing her tits all over it while she’s talking…there I go again.

OK now, before we adjourn for some practice of our own, let me suggest that you do indeed practice on your own, at least at first. The greatest speakers rehearse. You do want to know what you’re going to sound like, even to yourself. So say some erotic lines out loud a few times. Adjust your tone, your pace. Just say it a few times until it sounds good to you, this isn’t Broadway. It will alleviate some of the jitters of trying something new. And to me that’s what good sex is all about, trying something new.

I can practically hear some of you saying, "OK fine, I get the picture, but what do I say, what are the actual words." And no, I can’t send you a recording. But let’s look at it this way. Even taco sauce comes in mild, medium and spicy, right? Sometimes you might feel like mild or medium, sometimes you want some hot spice.

It’s the same with dirty erotic talk.

Mild would probably phrases like, "mmm…that’s nice," "feels so good," "yes…yes, right there," "Oh God, Pg 202

baby…yes," "I can’t wait to taste you," "I love what you’re doing to me…I love how it feels…I’ve been wanting you all day…" "Let’s make love until the sun comes up…" You get the picture, mix and match as you like. These are erotic words that should not have the beginner choking on them.

Once you get used to the mild sauce, or saucy comments, you may want to get a bit more creative. "I love how your cock feels inside of me," "Your pussy is so wet…I love how my cock feels inside of you," "Your juices taste so good," "Your body is so beautiful… oh my God, I can’t wait to taste every inch of you," "I love these breasts, I want to lick and suck them so hard…" "Wrap your legs around me, I want every inch of me inside of you," "I’m gonna suck your cock now baby…hold in tight,"

Let me just start breathing normally again for a minute. There. Now, you want spice? You want to bring it home to papa? Those who really like the salty stuff probably don’t need my suggestions. But hey, I’m the writer here, indulge me.

When you graduate to, "Spread those cunt lips my sweet little whore, I’m gonna slam you like Hulk Hogan,"

"I’m gonna suck your cock until every last drop of cum fills my mouth," "Don’t you dare cum until I give you permission," "Suck my cock you little whore," "Can’t you fuck any harder than that? – be a man!" "I want to taste your seed…cum on my face," "Bend over baby…you’ve been a bad girl and it’s time for your ass to pay…" now you know you don’t need my words. God, I do wish I could be there! How about sending me a tape?

My friends, I mean it when I say that some girls, and guys, are so aroused by dirty talk – often to their surprise –

they can’t believe it themselves. Imagine a girl who is the definition of proper at work, in the kitchen, at the gym, in church – whatever, but in the bedroom she likes to be called a ‘whore’ and have her ‘cunt fucked hard by you’. Or the conservative business dude who likes to tell her to ‘suck my cock like an ice cream cone until I tell you to stop.’ It can be so very hot, and you may not even know this vista of opportunity exists until you try it at least on some level. I sincerely hope you do

I'm nervous about talking "dirty" even though my experience proves otherwise. It takes me a while to "warm up" then it’s time to let the slut know how I expect her to be a good girl to Dad. The article did have some good advice and I appreciated the ideas.

Hey, this is a great piece! It's a fun read and good solid advice all around. Just wanted to share a couple things.

My wife (while an amazing lover) was kinda timid about expressing her sexuality verbally. Until one night after a few glass of wine we got to talking about our fantasies... After that, whenever she was feeling frisky, I'd wait until we were in the heat of passion and then ask her to describe her deepest, darkest fantasies to me, and although she was hesitant at first, over time her descriptions gave me a long list of erotic words and phrases that I knew she liked the sound of. So it was easy to figure out what she wanted to hear me say. And it worked the same way in reverse. After hearing a few of my fantasies she quickly learned all my favourite "trigger words" to get me going. I definitely agree about keeping the dirty talk "special." We practice Tantric sex, which is incredibly intimate, and well, spiritual for us. We found that keeping our "dirty" nights and our "clean" nights separate makes each kind of sex all the more powerful and meaningful in our relationship. As for always needing eye contact. Have to say, in my experience, there's nothing like having my wife whisper naughty fantasies in my ear so close I can feel her hot breath, and her sensuous lips between tantalizing phrases (shudder!). Sometimes, the words and tone of her voice alone are enough to send me reeling. I find it can really intensify the experience. Not to mention it's a good way for timid partners to ease into it without feeling self-conscious. Hope some of this is helpful. And thanks again for the excellent article!

Excellent advice and funny also. I'm afraid I am one of those who don't say a word during sex, but I had a lover 27 years ago who used to say things like "fuck me rotten" and "suck my cunt" and I've never forgotten it or what a turn on it was. So I will definitely give it a try. Thanks 05/16/08 by Carmelitta in France

I really love you "how to" articles... They are really well written and show how it's being done. ;) My boyfriend and I have had a long distance relationship for a year now and having phone sex really makes my day. Since we started having those conversations he gotta know my preferences so well, he can already almost make me cum with a simple text message and the other way round, though! I love writing him a little message once in a while... Are u hard, baby? Is your big cock throbbing because ur thinking of my juicy wet cunt and my tight little asshole? Cheerzz

My husband always talks dirty to me so now I feel I must return the favour. I do a lil bit here and there usually fuck me harder spank me etc. But I wanted to learn long phrases. I thought this was awesome and I'm calling him right now to leave him a dirty message.

I must say the article was totally awesome. I have my bf(he plays master to me... he loves to call me his filthylilwhore.... and ya know what? just like u said... each person is different in their likes... but when he whispers that in my ear... I’m putty in his hands...

Thanks for the suggestions, ALWAYS welcome. The contrast between a lady during the day and a slut in bed has great results, and I always wanted to know what men REALLY liked. This is good stuff. Want more!!!!!!!!!!!!

Two suggestions, actually... One, a bit mild, is to say, "What do you want me to do to you?" This opens up all sorts of possibilities and can be a bit overwhelming, actually. But it lets your partner know that you want to please him and that you care about what he wants. Two, a bit more specific and lot more hardcore... A man I know told me he wants to break his cock off in my ass. Hot hot hot. I'm telling you. Especially in public, whispered in your ear. Give it a try.

Hot damn, erotic talk is such a huge turn on. I'm glad I found your article. Thanks again.

Pillow Talk

It's amazing some of the things that you can get away with saying in bed. For instance, any other circumstance in which someone asks you to suck their dick would be considered pretty rude and inflammatory... but in bed it can be one of the biggest turn-ons one could possibly hear.

Now obviously not everyone likes to hear what can be considered "degrading" phrases or words in bed, but others do. And even those of the population who don't like to talk while the sex is going on, appreciate hearing a few compliments afterwards.

I'd like to look at some bedroom phrases and how they affect people (positively that is, we'll skip the negative part cuz it's rather pointless.). Hopefully using some of these phrases, words and compliments will help some people in their bedroom life. I've had friends ask me before just what they're supposed to say during sex, and what's off-limits. Who knows, maybe this will help some other people out too - that's the goal anyway!

Pg 204

We'll start with phrases that almost anyone would like.

Things that the menfolk would like to hear:

1. "You have such a big dick" = While I don't profess to totally understand this one, I have to admit, I'm not a guy. But I have not talked to a single guy that doesn't want to hear that from his girlfriend. It doesn't matter if he's not the biggest dick you've ever had, that's not what it's saying, what you are doing is acknowledging the fact that he is the one you're thinking of right now. He's there, he's huge, and he's splitting you open. That should be a turn on for both of you.

2. "That's it, right there... OH YES!" - or something similar to that. Now obviously, DO NOT FAKE THIS

ONE. But your man wants to know that he's getting it right, that he has the sexual prowess to have found one of your genuine hot spots. If you never tell him, how's he supposed to know? Sure, you're moaning, but you might be moaning throughout most of it, saying "Oh baby, yes, right there," lets him know without a doubt that he is pleasing you. And that's hot.

3. "Do you want me to do anything?" - ok, granted this one can backfire on occasion, he may not appreciate the interruption to his manoeuvres, and he may also fear that he's not doing it right. The trick to this one is to do it towards the beginning, and give him a sexy look, make sure that your body language is saying that he's doing EVERYTHING right to you and that you want to do something for him. The best part about asking this question is that if you do it in the middle of sex, you will get a multitude of answers that you may never otherwise hear. Why? Because he's in the middle of wonderful pleasure and the first thing that comes to his head is going to pop out of his mouth. That, and just the idea of you doing anything he wants is going to get him going even more.

4. "I'M CUMMING!!!!" - My absolute favourite. It should definitely be screamed at the top of your voice -

especially if there is the possibility of being overheard. Same as #2, you're letting him know that he's done good, that he did you good and that you love everything he's just done to you. And screaming it at the top of your lungs means that everyone will know just how good of a lover he is. Again, this is definitely NOT one that should be faked (I never understood why girls faked orgasms anyway, that just means that you're not getting YOURS! Silly people.). Now, my boyfriend is one who will try to quiet me when there's a chance of someone overhearing, but I've found that the few times I didn't utter this ecstatic phrase, the first words out of his mouth after sex were "Did you cum?". They want to know, since it's not always as easy to tell with girls.

Now guys, you didn't think you were going to get away without any helpful hints, did you?? Trust me, there are some things that ladies definitely like hearing in bed as well.

1. "You're so tight" has become quite a compliment. First of all it shows that you've noticed the effort we've been putting into our Kegel exercises. Secondly, when people think of sex they think of the virgin tightness, etc. We know that men want girls who are tight (why do you think the Kegel exercises were invented in the first place?), so acknowledging the superior tightness of our bodies is always a good move.

2. "Damn you look beautiful ." There is nothing more reassuring to a woman than having her partner tell her that she looks fantastic naked. Even better, naked and moaning. You're telling her that she doesn't have to get all dressed up, put on makeup and do her hair in order to look beautiful in your eyes; that she's perfect just the way she is right now.

3. "How do you do that?!" Any time you wonder that during sex, go ahead and utter the phrase. Let us know how shocked you are at the way we can clench around you, the fact that our legs go over our heads like that, anything we do that wows and amazes you. Why? Because that's letting us know just how fantastic our moves in bed are. Another good (and similar) one is "Oh, that feels GOOD!"

4. This may just be my personal thing, but I would really like my boyfriend to make noise. Any noise when he cums. Moaning my name would be fantastic (and actually, I think that one goes both ways -

everyone needs to moan their partners name! Just make sure that you're moaning the right name!).

Really though, any noise would be good. I've talked to a lot of girls, the vast majority of which agree Pg 205





that their partners don't make nearly enough noise when they're cumming - we want to hear the affirmation that we're pleasing you too you know!

Phrases (*a lot of*) guys love to hear:

Let me suck your big dick

I want you to cum in my pussy

Fuck me harder!

I want to be your little whore

I'm your fuck-toy

Phrases (*a lot of*) girls love to hear:

I could fuck you all night

Your pussy tastes sooo sweet

You have the hottest body... I just have to touch all of it.

I want to lick you all over.

You're like a sex goddess!

I have to say - although I know that this is not always the case - my absolute favourite thing to have my boyfriend say to me in bed, is when he says "Good girl...."

Well. My favourite except for those times when he tells me that I've been bad... wink

How to Talk Dirty to Your Man

So your partner has asked you to talk dirty him. You may think of yourself as kinky and that you have a dirty mind but when you try to talk dirty the words just don't come to you. If nasty talk doesn't come naturally to you then this how-to is for you.

Keep in mind is that he is a guy, his mind is dirtier than yours. Do you want to know what is inside that skull of his? A cesspool, that's what's inside. All you need to learn is how to send ripples through it.

1. Remember, he is the one that asked you to talk dirty. He has no complaints if you talk too dirty. Besides, the chances of you talking too dirty for him are slim. Don't hold back.

2. When you do talk dirty for him you are being a sexual object. Men are pigs. We have been programmed since birth to objectify women. That does not mean we do not love our spouses, girl friends, significant others, or whatever we call our partners. It means we have a sexual object that we fantasize about and at times we fantasize about the woman in our lives as being that sexual object. Are you willing to be a sexual object? Maybe it is something the two of you can discuss. Perhaps the two of you can discuss ground rules. Make sure you both know it is just a fantasy. You can always set a night for candlelight and soft music and then a night for talking to him like he was the pig that he is.

3. Dirty talk is spice. Too much can spoil the meal. Sprinkle those nasty words over the course of the evening. There is nothing like a good tease. Collect a repertoire of stock phrases. They don't have to be original. You are talking to cesspool after all. Use those phrases to set him up for the shocker. Use phrases that seem natural to you, but phrases using words like pussy, cock, and dick. 'I want you inside me' doesn't cut it. 'Fuck me with that dick' is better. Read stories on literotica. If you come across a phrase you like write it down. If you are comfortable doing so, watch some porn movies when your partner is not around and takes notes. You don't particularly have to like porn movies. You are just doing homework. If you don't want to see what is happening on the screen don't look. Just listen. If you do like porn get the vibrator out and have some me time.

4. Make sure you have a shocker. What is a shocker? A shocker is that really dirty, nasty, and disgusting phrase that closes the deal. It is the phrase that will have him wrapped around your finger. The good thing about a shocker is that is does not have to be spontaneous. In fact, during the time you are earning Pg 206





your potty mouth it is best not to be spontaneous. The best shockers in the beginning are planned. You have all the time in the world to come up with a shocker. Before your night of dirty talk sit down with a pen and notebook and figure out what your shocker is going to be. Now is the time to get that dirty mind of yours to work. Think of a theme for your shocker. Are you the sweet little girl, the slut, the evil bitch or do you have something even more devious in mind. Get in the mindset that you are playing a character. Get yourself into the role. Start trying to objectifying things. It is not "his" dick, but "that"

dick. It is just an object. It is not "your" pussy, but "that" pussy or better yet "that" hole. Objectifying is not a rule it is just something to just keep in mind. Think about whether it fits your theme or situation.

Finally the best shockers have a hint of the taboo in them. Referring to yourself as mommy or call him a slut (yes, I said him). The goal is to send him over the edge. You may be saying to yourself that you couldn't say something like that to him. What if it would freaks him out. I could only answer that by saying that he wasn't just asking you to talk dirty to him. He was asking you to fuck his mind.

5. Make sure to deliver the shocker properly. After all your work you wouldn't want the shocker to get lost unnoticed between "Oh, yeah fuck that pussy" and "and fuck me faster". Pace things. Set the scene, stop or slow things down if you need to, and make sure he is looking into your eyes when you are ready.

Now deliver the shocker.

"You motherfucker. You've turned me into slut haven't you?"

Of course replace this shocker with your own. Make it as nasty you want it to be.

6. Once you've gone through talking dirty a time or two throw this how-to away and do what comes naturally. Now you are really ready to use that dirty mouth of yours.

Since it was a short essay, it's no insult to mention that you missed another good source of dirty talk-the man in question. If he mentions something during sex, it's probably going to be part of his fantasy, therefore good fuel for the fire. For example, if he whips off with a "Who's your Daddy?" then a "Gimmie more cock, Daddy"

might just be in order. Paraphrasing is the key, of course. As to the previous comment about the author not providing enough ideas, I suggest that he is recommending that you tailor the patter to fit the lover. Porn is amazingly fertile ground for smut mouth, so that suggestion alone should be worth the read. If you can crib some lines from his favorite porn, that's usually a good bet. (The trick is to figure out which of his porn he considers the good stuff-guys tend to be a bit goofy about that.) 09/09/07 by Anonymous in California

I'm rather quiet by nature, and don't swear much in general, except for "crap" or "damn." But when a man turns me on, and I am in the midst of lust, I love the dirty talk. Both from him, and to him. The only thing I don't like is being called a whore or a slut, and I make that clear up front. I don't know if any of my ex's wished they could call me that or not. They never seemed to mind acceding to my wishes in that regard, and I must say, dirty talk is a cheap but very satisfying thrill.

The Art of Masturbation

….

For me, the best part of pleasuring yourself is the fantasies. There are no rules; nothing is out of bounds. No restraints at all. Creativity is king. You can be having sheet-tearing sex with anyone and everyone you choose, anywhere you like. Man, woman, cousin, movie-star, musician, athlete, teacher, pornstar, friend, boss…just to name a few. Inside, outside, in the movie theater, ski lodge, motel room, in the pool, on the desk, bent over the sink, in the shower…and I’m being tame.

Pg 207





And your object of fantasy can say whatever you want them to. How much they’ve always wanted you, how badly they need for you to make them cum…only you. Remember that high school flame you never got to fuck?

It’s never too late. Short skirt on the girl in the next cubicle got you revved up? Use that image. Mrs. Jones, your junior-high school teacher with the short skirts and great legs? The combinations of people and places and endless. That’s half the fun of it.

The other half is what your mind can conjure that rarely – or never – happens in real life for you. A friend of mine, for example, never has anal sex at home, but craves it deeply.

Her fantasy goes something like this:

She’s naked and blindfolded, laying face down on satin sheets. She can smell his cologne as he comes closer; hear his breathing. She jumps a little as she feels his tongue lick her ankle, making a wet path up her calf to her thighs. She shivers just a bit as her nipples begin to harden. Her legs start to spread all on their own, but he takes her ass cheeks in his strong hands and spreads them apart.

Her asshole is open and exposed as he first licks small circles around it. Wetness seeps from her swollen pussy as he sticks his tongue in her ass. Behind the blindfold, she sees stars – small explosions beneath her eyelids.

She feels his weight and the hard muscles of his chest against her back as he climbs on top of her. A brief flash of pain – or is it pleasure – and he’s inside her, his cock making long, smooth strokes in her ass.

She opens her mouth to say – something – but as his hands cover her breasts and squeeze her nipples, no words come emerge. The feeling of his cock moving in and out of her ass is exquisite, like nothing she’d felt before. It sends shivers up and down her legs, over her stomach and into her neck…

He whispers in her ear, “you like it in the ass, baby?”

“Yes,” she moans, “so much.”

“You like being my little whore, feeling my hard cock fucking your ass?”

“Yes…I want to be…need to be your whore.”

She feels the sharp crack of his hand on her ass.

“Yes…yes,” she cries, water seeping from the corners of her eyes, “Oh God…yeeeessssss.”

Again she feels the sting, again…until it blends with the dreamy feeling of his cock easily – surprisingly easily

– sliding in and out of her now willing ass. Her hands reach down to the smooth folds of her pussy and, spreading her lips, she rubs the hard nub that makes her jaw quiver. She feels the stirrings of the evening’s first orgasm about to intensify and overtake her…

HOW TO HAVE A XXX SEX LIFE - THE ULTIMATE VIVID GUIDE

Chapter 3 : Lip Service

Another Way to Use Your Mouth: Dirty Talk

I finally got into dirty talk! I prefer to listen and once in a while open my mouth, but if he's not saying anything, I will. It definitely makes sex hotter.

-Kira

Maybe you remember the scene in Bangkok Nights in which one of the brothel's regular clients asks his favourite prostitute to tell him, in great detail, about the sex she had with some of the other male visitors. Or the scene in Intimate Journey in which a woman describes her first experience with anal sex in painstaking detail.

dirty talk is sexy talk. And hearing it can often help conjure up the naughtiest fantasies in one's imagination.

Dirty talk sounds really funny, or trashy, when you're not having sex. But within the right context – like let’s say, the throes of passion-it can be a major turn-on.

Where would adult movies be without the words "oh yeah, oh yeah"? Dialogue is actually a big part of porn.

Chi Chi says, "I remember when videos just had music sound tracks back in the early 1980s. When the first movies [came] out with dialogue and dirty talk, it was just so thrilling and [it] added another level to the scenes.

And talk is very safe. You can say a lot of nasty things that you'd never actually do." What you say during sex an connect your mind and imagination to enhance the sensations your body feels.

We all know that whether you're in the boardroom or the bed room, sometimes it isn't what you say, but how you say it. There are many ways to converse during a scene; your words can range from normal conversation to sweet nothings, from hints about what you want to raunchy and raw talk. You may discover that a minimum of talking is best for you, or you might open up a whole new range of erotic possibilities. Talking during sex can be, as Chi Chi says, "a real turn-on and a stimulator. When performers talk to each other or even whisper kind of nasty things, they both get turned on, and the scene immediately becomes more intense." Kira said she even brought the dialogue from the set to her bedroom at home: "I had a boyfriend who kept doing it and it totally turned me off. But then with my next boyfriend, I felt something was missing, so I found myself talking, and now he's doing it, too. I prefer to listen, but once in a while I throw some words in for myself. If he's not saying anything, I will. It makes it hotter!"

Erotic talk can vary from mild to wild. What you say and how you say it depends on your style, your mood, and what's happening between the sheets. An easy way to begin sex talk is simply to verbalize how much you like your partner's looks, what your partner is doing, or how it makes you feel. Everyone likes to have their ego stroked as much as other parts of their body Telling your partner how beautiful or handsome they are can build their confidence, and the more confident they are, the better they can please you, and the more they can enjoy themselves. Plus, they are less likely to stop what they are doing to you. So if you want them to keep it up, keep talking! Dasha, whose native language is Czech, says, "I have an easier time talking dirty in English than I do in Czech. I don't even know how to talk dirty in Czech because it sounds silly in that language. But in English, I hear people do it all the time and it's easier; it adds a little spice."

You can also narrate the action in a sexy way: talk about what you're doing to your partner, what your partner is doing to you, say what you want to do, or what you're going to do. This all seems pretty basic, but in an erotic context, it really can add something to the experience for both partners. Choosing the words depends on what feels right and how hot and heavy you are. If you want to open up the dialogue, but feel uncomfortable using street slang, say something relatively tame like "I'm going to make you scream tonight." If you haven't got a problem using slang, or lines you picked up in a movie, try something more explicit, such as "I'm going to give you the best blow job you ever had." This cranks things up a notch. And if and when you're fairly comfortable with talking dirty, you can progress to something like "I'm gonna suck your dick so hard and so long that you'll Pg 209

be begging me to let you come." See what we mean? The more explicit it is, the more exciting it can be; especially if you only use this sort of talk in the bedroom.

I’m more of a sounds person; moans and things," says Mercedez. "Hearing sexy sounds can turn me on even more than hearing words. But sometimes, it helps to get him hard by telling dirty stories, or saying how bad I want it, or I tell him what I'm going to do when it gets hard. I tell him what kind of blow job I'm going to give him, and then do it." Briana keeps it simple: "Whispering in your ear is a great kind of foreplay. In my scenes, I just say what comes naturally, like what I am going to do to my partner or what I want him to do to me. Once in a while raunchy is okay, but for the most part, I'm not into gutter talk; I keep it sweet and hot."

If you'd really like to see our Vivid actors using dirty talk so that you can decide if it's right for you, check out The Most Girl in the World. The words seem out of context here, but when Tawny says to her boyfriend in the film, "Do you want to fuck me!" and "Faster, you fucking bitch; make me come," it seems perfectly right for the hard ass character she's playing. And remember, while you're having sex with someone, you can momentarily take on a different character as well. In Swoosh, a girl in the swimming-pool scene uses words that are hot but not vulgar when she says to a guy, "I'm nice and wet for you, huh!" But later in the same film, there's a scene in a remote shack that serves as a hideout for some tough-guy types and their babes. There, the talk is raunchier, with lines like "Is that what you want, you fuckin' whore!" Or "Take it, bitch." Or "Fuck me with that stick, baby."

No one wants a one-way conversation. To inspire your other half, ask questions like "How does this feel?" or

"Do you like what I am doing?" Pay attention to your delivery because a little breathiness for women, and a little forcefulness for men, can go a long way. You don't want to sound too businesslike or neutral, like a masseuse in a health spa, or the nurse in a hospital who just changed the bed linens. Put a little edge in your voice.

A fun little bedroom game is to take turns asking for something special that you want. It can be a foot rub, a blow job, or a spanking. This can be a great tactic for extending foreplay, too, if it seems like your partner needs to slow down a bit. Bobby encourages versatility: "There is a wide range of things I can say, depending on the scene. One minute I can whisper 'you're the most beautiful thing on earth' and touch her face and kiss her. Then I can cover her eyes and tell her what a dirty girl she is. I can be romantic or I can be naughty. It's a balance. I make her desired, secure, and safe. Then I can push the envelope sexually with what I say."

When most people think of "talking dirty" they think of using nasty, even degrading, language to make it hot.

When it works, it works well! Dirty talk can really supercharge the eroticism for those who get off on it, but we have a delicious paradox here. The dialogue in adult movies is not always brilliant, and if we're not aroused it can sound downright silly But when we are aroused dirty talk can stoke the fires even hotter by engaging our minds as well as our bodies. The trick is to say the kinds of things you hear adult performers say, but not to sound like you're in a porn movie when you say it. "I don't like nasty talk, but I like sweet nasty talk," says Bobby "Instead of hearing 'fuck my hole,' I would rather she said something ladylike, like 'give it to me harder, baby,' or I just like to hear her whimpers."Sunrise, for example, says she has no problem talking dirty on the set, but she doesn't really do much at home. "At work I'm a major talker, especially if I'm with a female. I can take control and give verbal commands and stuff like that. Say I'm holding her hair forcefully and telling her to 'eat me,' or 'fuck me with your tongue.' It's such a turn-on. And what you say doesn't even have to make sense for you to enjoy it!"

Remember, the goal in your scene is to have great sex with your partner-the only audience or director you have to please is you! "Me, myself, I'm not a big dirty talker," says Jenna. "I think it can be hot, but guys can go too far and say something that turns me off, then it throws my whole groove off. Maybe some things will come out of my mouth that a guy will really dig, but once you get going, it's important to concentrate on what you're doing. Moans and groans are hotter and more real for me." Generally speaking, you both have to be really into it Pg 210





for dirty talk to work. If one of you isn't into it, at best it will fall flat, and at worst you'll actually offend your partner. If there are certain words or phrases that bug you, by all means, let your partner know Guys take careful note here; women are more sensitive than men to slang words that refer to breasts and vaginas. For some women, "boobs" are okay, but "hooters" is unacceptable. Similarly, some women will think that "snatch" and

"pussy" are cute, but "cooter" or "cunt" are too raw.

Remember that dirty talk doesn't have to represent what you'd say to each other out of bed, and Justin reminds you to keep it in context:"Sex is supposed to be exciting and fun and passionate. What happens in the bedroom stays in the bedroom-you can be as dirty and nasty as you want as long as you're both into it and know it's part of the fantasy, "When the two of you know each other well, though, getting nasty from time to time can really help keep it fresh. As Bobby says, "If you can flip that switch, from soft and romantic to raunchy and randy, you can always keep her guessing. It will never get stale."

"You can talk about your fantasies during sex before actually enacting them," says Savanna, who admits she's not that verbal. Dirty talk is an opportunity for you to gauge your partner's interest in a particular fantasy. It can also be a safe way to test the waters before you buy the cheerleading uniform, take those tango lessons, or worse, invite the woman you met in Starbucks home for a threesome. Talk about that doctor-patient scenario or your sex-slave fantasy first, and see how your partner reacts. If something really works, you can ask later if the talk is as far as you want to take it, or if you're ready for the words to come to life.

As Chi Chi puts it, "You can be having everyday sex, but go off into another world by what you say." Imagine that you are stroking and stimulating your partner, but this time you're telling a story. Is he a captive on a planet of Amazons? Is she a princess being visited by her prince? Are you strangers who picked each other up at a bar?

Not surprisingly, all three of our directors described this style of dirty talk. With words you can create fantasies and scenarios without actually doing anything different from what you usually do. Justin's style dates back to early erotic memories: "When I was young, I started masturbating to stories in magazines like Penthouse Forum. I am not as turned on by just pictures. I'm more of a storyteller, and I like fantasy scenarios. So talking dirty came very naturally to me. People should feel out their partners, discover what they fantasize about, then create a fantasy for them through words."Try weaving an erotic tale of your very own, or borrow" one from an erotic novel or story and make it your own.

Vivid director Paul Thomas spices his sex life up this way: "When you're in a relationship, it's very difficult to be original and creative because you inevitably begin to repeat the same phrases and words. It's necessary to personalize it, to bring other people and events into it. In my relationship we don't see other people, but I'm still encouraging her to talk to me about men and women she sees and to 'lie' to me while I'm aroused, invent some outrageous situation that happened to her, like 'Did I tell you about the cabdriver I had today? Oh my God . . .

And for the time being, I buy into it."

Dirty Dialing

If you want to try giving honey some "lip," but you can't do it face-to-face, you might try something that's exciting, but keep; a little distance between you-a dirty phone call. For tips and pointers on this, check out the film Obsession, and play close attention to the part where the stalker, watching through a window nearby, calls the guy and tells him where and when to touch himself. Mesmerized by her voice and the mysterious fact that she can see him he can't see her, he does exactly as she says.

HOW TO FUCK A WOMAN’S BRAINS OUT

www.ThornDaddy.com

CHAPTER 6 Let’s Jump Right In....

My “Non-Script”

You can do anything you want with a woman in bed, if there’s mutual respect, the safeword is honoured, and you talk about lines not to cross ahead of time. I recommend doing one good basic vanilla (but spirited) fuck to

“get her”, then discuss what will work and what doesn’t, then GO FOR IT. Take control.

Different submissive women tend to all like the same stuff that I do with everyone in bed, but a few have boundaries particular to them, and it’s your duty to know these boundaries.

….

I keep petting her, and speak in a low, natural and commanding voice. (Women are attracted to a great voice. If you don’t have one, you’re at a disadvantage, but if everything else about you, about the “whole package” as I’ve described it throughout this book is in place, you’re still golden.) I speak to my bitch to reassure her, to soothe her mind, and to bring her more under my spell. This is not a trick, and it is not any type of “hypnosis.” It’s just one soul taking charge gently and realistically of another, with permission, and soothing my mind and body into hers.

I’ll tell her she’s safe. This isn’t a lie, as she is safe. I’m not going to take her anywhere she’s not ready to go, not going to do anything she doesn’t want me to do.

I tell her she’s a dirty, sweet little whore, made for the pleasure of men. This is true, and I do stress the “sweet”

part. I’m honoured that this slut is parting her pretties for me, and I’ll be good to them, and good to her.

I nibble on her nape, hunching over the woman’s body with mine a few inches above hers. I’ll pull her hair, very gently, while gauging how hard or how soft she likes everything. I’ll kiss around her ear, suck her lobes and whisper more about how she’s a dirty little girl, and how I’m here to celebrate her by nailing her to the centre of the earth with my cock. I don’t yet touch or go near her pussy. It’s all about stimulating her sacred mind at this point.

….

I keep playing with her body, calling her sweet dirty names and saying sweet dirty things to her. If she ever safewords out, I STOP IMMEDIATELY AND UNTIE HER. But if she doesn’t, I experiment with what she likes, with what I like, and play her body like a sacred instrument.

Once her body and words are telling me to fuck her, I’ll make her beg a little, especially the first time. And then play with her pussy, but not fuck her, for about 20 more minutes. Then I’ll finally slid into her with my cock, look her into her eyes, and fuck her like it’s the last thing I’ll ever do. I cum in her, and it doesn’t end there.

CHAPTER 7 Kings Don’t Live This Well

MORE FUN STUFF

Talk Dirty!

In bed, outside the bed, and via e-mail when she’s at work. My woman loves this. Yours may too.

Pg 212

For e-mail, make sure she’s got a job where this won’t get her fired, and have her use a G-Mail account, not her work e-mail. I made Dollie set up a G-Mail account that only I know the address of. That makes her know she’s special. And the user name I made her get is something like DaddysLittleSlut_69 (that’s not it, but you get the idea).

The mind is the most important sex organ, and good dirty talk “speaks” to that.

Talking dirty is an art. Both in what you say, and in how you say it. I like to say it in a soft/loud/soft/loud/soft way, often right in her ear. That makes her really hot, and she becomes more open to me, because she doesn’t know what to expect. The soft opens up her heart, and the loud makes her stand at attention in her brain.

Here’s some examples (transcribed by marion of The House of Reason from stuff I said to Dollie and the pet during sex, recorded, and put on Submission and Coffee. Thanks marion!) Read this and then use it to learn to do your own.

I love you, baby....Daddy is here....you are safe in my hands. I care about everything that happens to you. You are my baby-doll. Shhhhh. . .quiet my sweet little squirmworm...father loves you....I am here to protect and nurture you....I adore you and love you and only you. . .I validate and verify and authenticate you, sweetie. I GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO EXIST. YOU ARE MY WOMAN. I AM YOUR MAN....You completely complete me and endorse me. You are my reason to love. I have never loved another human the way that I love you. You are my rockin’ little sperm-trap lovergurl. Me poca mariposa, you are my only darling, my fluffpuff kittywhore....

Baby come here! Look how much cum is on this spoon. Look, come here. Eat Daddy’s cum and cum for Daddy… NOW LICK ALL THAT CUM UP…Good girl. Cum for your Master, cum bitch, cum for your Master. Cum for the Daddy, stay for the whippins.

Beautiful little slut, kiss mew....Mew, mew for Daddy. Mew like a retarded kitty. Good little cum toilet....and you’re both twitching.... panties down around your legs like dirty little fucking sex crime victims, I like it. Ohh, twitching like a bitch, yes you are, oh good girls, good girls, hi Dollie, love you baby! Hey pet, good girl! Kiss my back and rub my balls while I fuck her, I like it.

Good girl. You are my little cum toilet. Cum for Daddy. Mew for Daddy. I like it. You are a good little slut.

You’re a dirty little cock sucking whore, oh baby, did I harm you? No? Good! Good girl! I’m going to nail you to the centre of the earth with my cock.

Talking dirty while paddling a woman’s ass is absolutely wonderful. Try it!

I.M. “On your knees, bitch!” stuff, but fucking poetry for the ages. Dollie and I write this kind of stuff and send it to each other by e-mail, and she leaves it for me on handwritten notes when she leaves for work, for me to read when I wake up.

(Read Dollie’s book Diary of an S&M Romance. It has a lot of the e-mails we sent each other early on when we were courting. It’s beautiful.)

Note from Dollie when I emailed her the previous chapter to proof at in her cubicle on her lunch hour: Pg 213





Yummy! Reading that “how to fuck” part made me remember the oh-so-many times you did exactly all that - now I’m twitchy and damp, and heading for the ladies’ room when I’m done writing this. You are the god of Fuck, Daddy.

And I love the intro to the “advanced” chapter - can’t wait to read it - tonight?

My writing stirs my wife, and I also love that, through books like this and the podcast, it’s a love song for all the cubicle girls in the world. (A lot of women listen to us fucking and talking on Submission and Coffee at their desks on ear buds. I love that. It’s a global gang bang with me, my wife, the pet, and 10,000 ladies.) e-mail from Dollie to me from her while at work:

Daddy, thank you for making my life so wonderful. For teaching me, training me, loving me, spanking me, fucking me, and being my best friend. For believing in me, and bringing out the best in me.

And for putting a toy hedgehog in my purse! Mew!

You do own me, Daddy, body and soul, heart and mind, pussy,

ass and mouth.

—Daddy’s little cube slut

My Thoughts

When and Why a Partner May Participate in the Training Sessions Twice above I have mentioned items that indicate a value in partner participation. I said: “They were able to accomplish this by…. 3-accepting repeated encouragement to”, and that one of the values of partner participation is “to whisper encouragement.”

The first requirement is that the partner be someone the woman cares about and respects. Without this, she should not allow partner participation. With this, the partner can be of tremendous help. I am of the opinion that one of the reasons many women hold back and do not respond as completely as they might is because they are afraid they might look foolish or in some way embarrass themselves. A knowledgeable partner can help them past this by not only giving them permission but by also giving encouragement to reach a higher plateau.

If the partner were to sit on the stool with their legs and arms around her, they can kiss, touch, massage, and as she humps the Sybian, can hump her back. Once she starts to have orgasms the most important thing to do is whisper in her ear. The user should do all of the things discussed above and in particular keep her eyes closed and concentrate on the good feelings being created. Once she starts to have orgasms she should not try to have any form of conversation. This would tend to bring her out of the trance like state. Not good! She should not think during a session. Only feel. Her only form of communication should be in the form of expressing the emotions she is feeling. Moaning, screaming or saying “I’m Coming” are all forms of expressing emotions.

This is good!

The first stages of a session with the Sybian should be a continuation of Foreplay that started in advance. Once the session has advanced to where the partner can see that she is starting to respond, start to whisper in her ear.

The patter should be continuous and should not include any questions that would be asking for a verbal response other than to say “if you are coming, tell me”. Otherwise the patter should only use things that are truthful. While whispering, communicate as if it is the partner who is having intercourse with her. This makes it is easier for her to detach herself from the fact she is using a mechanical device. In such sessions, I have heard Pg 214

many say that they became oblivious to the fact that the Sybian was involved. A good sales pitch is hard to resist.

The patter might include such things as:

 I Love You

 You feel wonderful

 I love holding you like this

 Hump

 Try to push my cock out of you

 keep your eyes closed

 squeeze my cock as hard as you can

 I want you to let it all out

 hump me and let everything go

 tell me when you are coming

 you’re doing great

 fuck me hard

 give it to me

 you’re beautiful

 I love you

 keep it going

 don’t stop

 let everything go

 don’t hold back

 fuck me

 don’t stop

 keep it going and get rid of all that poison

 keep your eyes closed

 go ahead and scream

 you feel wonderful

 fuck me

 don’t stop

 keep it going

 I love holding you when you are coming

 you are so beautiful when you are coming

 go ahead and scream

 keep fucking me hard

 I love you

 it feels wonderful when you fuck me like this

Keep her going as long as you can but when you sense that she cannot continue any more on this orgasm, let the rotation continue at full speed and say: I am going to stop fucking you (as you turn off vibration) for a moment and I want you to sit still and keep your eyes closed and just enjoy the feeling of my cock moving inside of you.

Just enjoy the wonderful feelings you have. Don’t move and keep your eyes closed. You are wonderful and I love you and you are doing great. After 15 to 30 seconds say: I want you to fuck me some more (as you turn vibration back on) and I want you to let everything go this time. Don’t be holding back. This two part sequence can be repeated for as many times as you wish and as long as she has the stamina to do so. One thing I did not include in the above patter is the use of her name. It is definitely advantages to call her by name about every fourth comment.

I was reluctant to use the word “fuck” in this writing. I decided to do so for several reasons. First, three Psychologists (they were also licensed Sex Therapists) have told me that when used during Intercourse it is a very powerful aphrodisiac, even to those who would object violently to its use during a regular conversation.

Secondly, I have seen the magic results myself. Third, I have noted that when reversed it is always a turn-on to me.

Talking dirty

While I’m not an expert at talking dirty by any means, it is something husband and I have been exploring more recently. I’m glad to do my best answering this question.

First off, to talk dirty I need to silence my inner librarian. This is the chick that makes me feel silly and hesitate to say what I’m thinking. While she has her place at church or in a family gathering, my inner librarian shouldn’t get in the way of some good dirty talk.

I think the key is just to dive in, whether I feel silly or not. The more turned on I get, the easier it is.

Try turning it into a story about exactly what you want to do to him when you see him. Don’t try to get too elaborate, just start at the very beginning and slowly work your way to the juicy parts. Describe how he makes you feel and how you want to make him feel.

Just like actually having sex, phone or text message sex should have plenty of foreplay. If you dive straight to fucking like bunnies it’s not going to last long, is it? While it isn’t exactly hardcore dirty talk, I’d start with simple fantasy talk and work your way up.

So I can give you an example of that, let’s imagine my husband is away on a business trip. He’s been gone for about four days and the sexual tension and frustration is building, with several days more to go before he’s home again. Every night when we talk on the phone, things get a little wilder. Here’s what I might say to him.

(An example from a Woman’s perspective – but still informative)

It really has been too long since I touched your skin, lover. All day long, when I think about when we can finally be together again, it makes me squirm in anticipation. Sometimes, at odd moments, when I’m at work or doing chores around the house I find myself thinking of you. I feel my panties growing wet just at the thought of what I’d do to you if I could.

If you were here, without a word said I’d be in your arms, pressing my body hungrily against yours. Our lips would meet, searching, tasting, devouring. We’d make our way, barely separating, to the nearest available surface and lay down. As we pressed closer and closer I would feel your cock hardening, pressing into me, waiting.

My hands would be begin to roam your body, first your back, your shoulders your arms, your ass. Then I’d move away from you just far enough to reach down and touch your hardness, straining to be released from your pants. I’d free you so my hands could touch the soft skin of your cock, running my fingers lightly around the head and gripping your shaft, moving slightly up and down. Tired of the restriction of clothing, we rip them off, finally able to press our bare skin together.

Finally, I won’t be able to take it anymore. I’ll have to have your cock in my mouth. I push you back, flat on your back, and take you into my mouth. Your hardness fills me, while I run my lips and tongue over the soft skin surrounding your hardness. You begin to moan softly. Eventually I’ll taste your golden pre-cum at the tip Pg 216





of your cock and I lap it all up.

As I suck your cock your fingers find my clit. Waves of pleasure wash over me and the wetness between my legs increases. I’m so turned on I desperately need you inside me. And yet, I’m torn. I’m loving it right where I am. Eventually, the need to be fucked, hard and fast, wins out. I beg you to fuck me, and you come in inside me from behind, riding me hard and fast until we both have explosive orgasms and collapse, completely satisfied and exhausted.

More talking dirty

I love dirty talk. I’m not sure why, but the sound of my husband telling me " That’s right slut, take that cock all the way in your mouth " makes me go wild. At my request, husband talked dirty to me and it made me cum over and over. I sucked his cock the whole time, moaning and my body writhing as he told me to " Suck me hard, my little cockwhore. Don’t take it out of your mouth. Keep sucking "

I straddled him, sliding my wet pussy over his cock as he stimulated me to orgasm after orgasm with his fingers.

He called me his bitch, his whore his cockslut and I screamed in pleasure. When I moved back to sucking his cock, ass in the air near his head, clit being stimulated by his fingers he told me, "Lick that pussy juice all off, cunt. That’s a good little bitch, lick it all clean"

It was amazing. His words got me off, intensifying and increasing my orgasms, so I hardly knew where one let off and another began.

The more turned on I got, the more attention I slathered on his swollen cock. The more I wanted him deep inside my mouth, moaning and calling me dirty names. I sucked him on my hands and knees and then in my new favourite position: on his side with my head pillowed on his thigh. In fact, for good measure, we did them over again a couple of times. To top it off, I hung my head over the edge of the bed and he fucked my face as I massaged his balls.

By the time husband finally fucked me I’d orgasmed somewhere into the double figures. That meant my favourite kind of fucking, no holding back, hard and deep with quick intense orgasms for both of us. (In my case, two more.)

Dirty Talk - Basics

You are laying beside your partner, feeling their naked skin caress yours. Their chest rises with every whisper of a breath. You can feel their warm lips against your neck, and all of sudden, the sexually enticing words rush through your body like a jolt of energy. Have you wanted to unleash that wild side of yours through dirty talking, but haven’t found the courage, or don’t even know where to start? Here we have gathered techniques to teach beginners exactly how to do so. There are tips for breathing, body movements, sounds and the actual phrases themselves. The most important thing about talking dirty is how you say it, rather than what you say!

Creating Mood

For some, the first attempt at talking dirty with a partner can seem to be quite awkward. To eliminate some of that initial embarrassment, you should mention both the idea of the experiment to your partner as well as the limit of your desired kinkiness. The latter is created to help avoid a negative reaction from your partner in case you go "buck-wild" too quickly and cross their own personal boundaries. However, this chat should not occur directly before the incident; this could create massive unwanted pressure. Let’s face it – most people do not want be in the bright spot light when beginning to speak dirty.

Pg 217





Creating a sensual mood is an essential basic to letting that naughty side out of you. No, no - - put that Barry White CD down! The aura I have in mind could be considered a little peculiar, for it consists of a rhythm of breaths and body movements, rather than the soft music and candles, as most would expect. Yet you can also use those if you feel it adds to turning you on. This aspect is the most important part of dirty talking, because it is not what you say, but how you say it. You could say the dirtiest thing in the world and yet sound as sexy as an electronic encyclopedia.

Breathing

Stabilizing your respiration is quite significant for it distinguishes the difference between speaking normally, and talking dirty. You should begin by imitating the deep breaths you take in the doctor’s office as he/she listens to your lungs. You have the option of breathing through your nose, mouth or both. If decide to breathe through your mouth, you do not want to form a large “o” shape with your lips. Come on, you are not a pet waiting for a treat from its owner. Instead your mouth should be slightly open, no bigger than the point of your index finger. This seems to produce a more appealing expression...

The speed of the breaths should coordinate with the progression occurring from body movements, foreplay or intercourse. If you are about to make sensual love, then the breaths should be slow, and if you are about to imitate a wild rabbit gone mad, then the breaths would obviously be faster.

After accomplishing a stable beat, you should be examining the sound of your respiration. Most importantly, your exhaling should faintly die off. If the exhale breath stays one tone, it could seem abrupt and almost forced.

To help you visualize the sound of this breathing technique, picture a roller coaster. As it shimmies up the tracks, you inhale. As it pauses for a mere half a second at the top, so do you. Then as it coasts down the tracks until slowing down for the next hill, you make the initial part of the exhaling breath a little loud and then slowly become quiet. You may want to consider practicing this routine when you are by yourself.

Adding Sounds

Once you feel comfortable with this breathing technique, you can begin to make sounds as you exhale. These sounds should usually be instinctive and relaxed such as "uh," "ah," "oh," or "mmm." Here you are able to comfortably drop your jaw to widen your mouth if wanted. Do not analyze these sounds; there is no need to worry whether you are making a correct sound. If you unsure, a good rule is that you can rarely go wrong with vowels rather than some awkward consonant. For example, perhaps you choose the sound "bah;" you will ultimately sound like one very naughty, moaning sheep.

The trick with these sounds is that you are not being loud; actually you are being quite faint. The desired outcome is for your voice to barely seep out. Technically, this is speech sound articulated by a momentary closing of the glottis in the back of your throat, hence restricting the airflow. In laymen terms, you are making a murmur sound or a loud whisper. This is also commonly known as a “sexy voice.” If you are having difficulty reaching this volume, imagine being backstage at a play. All of a sudden, the main character draws a blank and completely forgets all his lines. It is entirely up to you to whisper the lines loud enough for the actor to hear, but not loud enough for the audience to hear.

Adding Body Movements

To perfect the rhythm, you now want to add body movements. Desirably, the body movements should be in perfect harmony with your respiration; the body movement should begin and end when a breath begins and ends. As you inhale, your chest should ever so slightly rise in an upward and diagonally out motion. Naturally, your shoulders will delicately move backwards and your upper back should arch with this motion.

There are many different techniques for exhaling. You can simply let your chest, shoulders, and upper back return to their original positions. This can resemble a relieving motion. Another option is to add a subtle pelvic thrust. As you inhale, let your lower back arch so your pelvis and buttocks are being pushed outwards. Your Pg 218





abdominal muscles are being elongated. As you exhale, squeeze your buttocks and bring your pelvis forward in a scooping motion, from a side angle, until back to its original position.

To add some difficulty to these movements, try adding an abdominal contraction as you are about to make the scooping motion. A contraction is the tensing of muscles. An abdominal contraction resembles the same motion your abs make if they are about to be unexpectedly punched; your shoulders move a little forward as the abs are pushed against your back. Ultimately, the contraction should make your pelvis finish the scooping motion by delicately going upwards and back down to its original state. From a side view, the path of your pelvis should resemble the digit, "six."

For those looking for even more difficulty, let the quiver of the contraction be heard in the exhale breath. This sound can be quite sexual, for you can tie it to dirty talking concerning ejaculation. Even though all these movements are critical, you do not want to overdo the actions. You aren’t trying to get the attention of a plane.

Keep it subtle or you’ll be doomed to the funky chicken dance.

You can also add other smaller body movements to the rhythm such as the arching of your neck, the closing of your eyes, and the clenching of your hand or the biting of your bottom lip.

Dirty Talk - Advanced

Now that you should hopefully have awakened your partner’s libido, it is time to put on that final touch. Check out our Dirty Talk Basics guide (if you haven't already) first, then read on below to refine and enhance those skills. Keep in mind the basic guidelines; like deep breaths and sounds, your words should also be in sync with the rhythm you have just created. The inhale breath should almost always be heard by your partner and you should speak in the "sexy voice" on the exhale breath. Enunciate all your words to your best degree.

To begin you should focus on these following questions: Which of my partner’s skills or attributes turn me on? How do they make me feel? How am I feeling right now? Dirty talking is mostly concerned with momentous sayings, so you should try to let your instinct carry you. If you feel that your partner is hot, call it as it is: "you are so hot!" If you feel that their touch makes your genitals quiver, say it: "Your touch makes my cock/pussy quiver." If you feel that you are very hard/wet, state it: "I’m so hard/wet right now."

However, a good rule of thumb is to avoid the word "because." You are not writing an essay question. This will avoid sounding dull and it will also add urgency. In a sense, you may be cramming a long portion of a sentence in an exhaling breath so this forces you to say it very quickly, which emphasizes that urge. For example: "You laying there naked makes my cock/pussy hard/wet because I find you to be so irresistible." You may be feeling this, but this is a bit long. Try separating the fragments with breaths. Long inhale, "You lying there naked," quick inhale “Makes my cock/pussy hard/wet" inhale "You’re irresistible." This style sounds more natural than mechanical, which is the intention of good dirty talk.

Another added bonus of separating the sentence is that it allows you to think on the spot. You can simply state something without wondering whether it’s long enough, or why you feel that way. State the phrase, breathe, and add to it.

To turn up the dirty talking a bit, you should focus on this question: What do I want to happen to my partner or to me? Do not be intimidated. Think about things like foreplay, oral, anal, the use of toys, different positions, being spanked, etc. The answers to this question can be transformed into very naughty phrases. These are all within you, for only you know what you want. Ok, so you can cheat if you really need to: if you draw a complete blank, watching adult films for inspiration is always a possibility. Nevertheless, you should look deep within yourself and bare all your dirty fantasies. (Long inhale) "You just got out of the shower (couple of breaths), I just want to fuck you until you can't walk anymore (inhale), Cum/spray all over you (inhale) ...

(quivering exhale/inhale), get you all dirty again."

Pg 219

After letting out some of your wants and desires, you may want to consider adding some more emphasis on certain subjects. One option is to add those initial sounds as previously mentioned. "Uh (inhale), I want to eat out your pussy/suck your dick (inhale), aah." Repetition is used to emphasize the importance of an action.

"Pound me! (Long inhale). Come on (quick inhale), pound me! (Inhale), pound me harder!" You can also use adjectives and adverbs. "My nipples want your soft lips to slowly suck them and then bite them hard."

Using singular adjectives or adverbs can also be a relief from always hearing the combination of an adjective before a noun. Make sure to stress the last syllable in the word to create more of an impact. For example, the word "wet" should be pronounced as "wet-te." (Long inhale) "I love it when I/you push my/your cock so far into you/me (inhale), I feel it touching all your/my walls inside (inhale), warm (inhale), wet (inhale), moist (inhale), tight."

To avoid sounding redundant with vocabulary, attempt using metaphors, such as "I want to feel my/your essence leaking out of me." For a more aggressive touch, using cursing can be quite thrilling. Compare “You are such a great lay" to "Holy shit! You are such a great fucking lay!" Other examples are "Fucking bang me harder, bitch/bastard," "Fucking smack my God-damned ass," and "Jesus, it just feels so bloody good that I want to fucking cum all over you." Here you are able to speak louder because these phrases tend to be more aggressive.

Be sensitive to your partner's responses - some people may find it incredibly erotic (in the heat of the moment) to be referred to in an unusual (perhaps even degrading) way, such as a "my little whore" or "my dirty bastard", but others may be very offended. If you sense shock (or feel it yourself), then talk about it afterwards and reassure each other that it is just 'play'. In any case (as with anything new) start off slowly, monitor the response -

and adjust accordingly.

Roleplaying can also be considered a section of dirty talk because even though you may be acting, there is massive dialogue. Roleplaying basically concentrates on acting on your or your partner’s fantasies. This tends to be more difficult because you need to fully understand your fantasies by knowing the role of both you and your partner. For example, you need to know if your partner ought to be dumb, wild, shy, mean, etc. An easy angle to start with is the dominant and submissive roles. You choose one of these roles while your partner must choose the opposing role or vice versa. The dominant figure tends to be more aggressive in their wants and desires. They must take charge: command and demand. "I am going to handcuff you to the bed, and you better not squeal." "Spread your legs now!" There are two sides of being submissive: the willing and the refusing. As a willing figure, you may decide to either solely perform the actions or perform with the purpose of liking them.

If you are a refusing figure, you may decide to perform the commands while begging for mercy or perform after intense threats. In a case you are finding that your partner is having difficulty taking on the role of a dominant figure, you can then ask defiant questions. "What are you going to do if I refuse to even kiss you, never mind suck your cock eat out your pussy?" If the dominant partner is still not responding, then you answer the questions. "Will heshe smack me, or pin me down? " Here the submissive partner is offering material that the dominant partner would hopefully be able to work with. There are many situations where dirty talking can be used in role playing: nurse and her not-so-sick patient, the student begging for a better grade, a master and his slave, Cleopatra seducing Caesar, popular cheerleader with the average guy, etc. Remember that the trick to having a great roleplaying session is to act out exactly what you crave as long as it is to a safe degree.

It is absolutely necessary to practice dirty talking with a partner that you are comfortable with. This will allow you to say exactly what you are striving for and in the end satisfy your wants and needs. Everyone has the potential of being a great dirty talker as long as you remember to work with your own instincts and try to be as natural as possible. The techniques and tips here are not etched in stone so feel free to add your personal style to Pg 220





them and to focus on your partner's feedback. Please keep in mind that practice makes perfect and that variety is the spice of life.

Phone Sex

Phone sex is probably one of the more common 'alternative' types of sexual encounter. Both men and women of many different ages have tried it, but many of us get their first taste of it at a young age, often when at a distance from a partner, keeping in touch by phone.

Phone sex is a fairly ‘safe’ style of alternative sexual contact, as there is no physical risk at all, except for what you do to yourself. Phone sex basically amounts to Masturbation while talking to someone on the phone. Of course there is a small risk of having your feelings hurt if someone embarrasses you, but this only usually happens with people you don’t know. Most of us perform phone sex with a known partner, so it’s basically risk free.

Some people find phone sex easier than actual sex. One reason for this might be that, for folks who are a little sensitive or self conscious, it allows them to avoid embarrassment. Others like the fantasy or Role Playing aspect, where they can imagine the erotic details themselves and set up the perfect sexual fantasy. No matter what the reason, there is much you can do when your partner is unseen.

What you can do when you’re having phone sex is limited only to your imagination. Most people appear to feel that the more creative you get, the better the sex. You could be in any room, doing anything. If you have a cordless hands-free phone, your options multiply. One word of caution – avoid the bathtub. We all know electricity and water don’t mix. As with any form of sex, as long as nobody gets hurt and everything is agreed to, anything goes.

What is important from the start when having phone sex with a partner that you’ve known for a while is to learn each others ‘comfort zones’. What are you comfortable with, and what is a little ‘out there’ for you. Discuss it before hand, and get a little idea of what each of you might like or dislike. Knowing this can make all the difference in the quality of your next encounters.

Although most people think of phone sex as being a 'guy thing', especially with the way phone sex ads are set up most of the time, its interesting to find that many women enjoy good phone sex as well.

What is ‘good’ phone sex? It is individual for each person, but the gender difference appears to be that while most men enjoy the sound of a woman getting off, making moaning and other sounds of pleasure, women appear to like the psychological element of fantasy with their phone sex partners. But again, it really is a personal choice.

One big question for many people is "How do I bring it up with my partner?" - especially when they are unsure of whether their partner would be interested. To start with, it should be mentioned as casually as possible. Most people are at least a little nervous about talking about sexual preferences with new partners, or even established ones. It's something to try when the subject of sex is already on the table.

For example, when one partner is going away and someone says ‘I guess we’d better find ways to please ourselves for a while…” you have a great lead in. The important thing is to go into it when the subject of sex is already naturally there. If you don't try to force it, things should flow more naturally.

Of course, you don’t have to wait for your partner to go far away before you try out phone sex! Try it as a new twist for someone close by. Phone sex makes a great early experiment for couples looking into new ideas.

Pg 221





Icebreakers are a big key. Once you get the ball rolling, the rest tends to follow pretty naturally. You might start by gently describing what you want to do to partner. "You know what’s really nice? When a (woman/man)..."

Some people use humor – "If you were here, I'd slap you on the ass and say..." or "I’d slap you on the ass and call you my little..." You fill in the blanks with what sounds good to you. Just think of how you can make a gentle sexy comment to test the waters and let things go from there. Check out our articles on Dirty Talk -

Basics and Advanced - for ideas of how you can get this going, or enhance your existing repertoire!

With all this talk about phone sex, there ought to be at least a mention of paid phone sex lines. Yes, paid phone sex can be highly erotic. It’s the reason these lines of lines are so popular – a lot of people enjoy them. The biggest advantage here is that you don't have to prepare to talk to someone, or break the ice. You get on the line, and they’re ready to go. This might be an option for people wanting to get the flavor of phone sex without the risk of being turned down. It’s also one way of getting to know if phone sex is 'your kind of thing', and whether phone sex with an established partner is possible and enjoyable for you.

The downside is, of course, the cost. Paid phone sex is expensive. And there is the added disadvantage of the few 'bad apples' that will overcharge and charge for services you didn’t want. You can avoid a lot of this by going with some of the bigger, more established lines. Looking for names of companies that have been around for a while can help you get the most for your money here.

Overall, phone sex can be a great addition to your sexual repertoire, with lots of positives and very few negatives compared to some other types of alternative sex. If you haven’t done so already, give it a try!

BANG – BY ROOSH VALIZADEH

Chapter 4 - Late Game - pg 112

Since sex is supposed to be fun, don't take it too seriously by questioning whether you are doing things right.

Other than some typical dirty talk like, "You like that, don't you?” don't ask if you are pleasing her. Also, after sex, don't ask if she came. If she cares enough about her pleasure then she will bring it up by telling you the things she wants or does not want you to do. It's best to do your own thing and what you enjoy because if you are enjoying it then chances are she is enjoying it too. Worrying about her pleasure sacrifices your own, and in the end doesn't guarantee that she will be pleased.

Once sex ends, you are going to feel the urge to fill the silence with talk, but resist that and stay cool. The less you talk the better because she will wonder what you are thinking and feel a little bit insecure and vulnerable.

Plus most of the stupid things I've ever said to girls have happened right after I had sex with them. Instead of talking, touch her, stroke her hair, cuddle or go to sleep. Remember: sex isn't a big deal - it's a natural act between two people who like each other. How you treat her after sex should be the same with how you treated her before. The last thing you want is get needy and act like you are falling for her.

Shake It Up, Baby! Sex Adventures For Truly Daring Duos

Talk Dirty to Me

Weaving in some X-rated conversation while your hands are wandering can make for an incredibly erotic experience. If you tend to get tongue-tied, here are a few pointers to get you started. First, you and your partner should have a discussion about exactly which words you find a turn-on and a turnoff. Some women, for example, might find it hot to hear someone call them a "slut"; others might totally detest the term. Likewise some men may prefer you call their equipment a "cock" rather than the diminutive-sounding "will y." Our point is that the very same lovemaking lingo can trigger completely different reactions based on whom you're talking to, so it can help to come to an agreement beforehand on which words you should use and which you should avoid.

Once you've got some hot vocabulary to work with and your hands start roaming, what next? Basically, there are three very easy ways to break the ice.

 The first and probably easiest is to merely ask your partner a question, such as "Do you want me to touch your [fill in the blank]?" or "Why don't you come over here and play with my [fill in the blank]?"

 The second way to get started is to describe something you're about to do "Next I'm going to put my fingers in your [bleep]" or something you're currently doing "Now my fingers are sliding inside your

[bleep]".

 Finally, you can ask your partner if he or she likes the results "Do you like it when I [bleep] your

[bleep]?".

Pretty much all of these explicit talk techniques can also be used during phone sex (and just think of how happy your partner would be to receive that call). So if one of you is on a business trip or you two are otherwise miles apart, pick up the phone (preferably at a time when you know your partner has some privacy) and say, "J wish you were here so 1 could throw you down on the bed and ... " Or describe what you're doing to yourself, as in,

"Now my hands are fondling my nipples, caressing my stomach, slipping under my pants. ." Those are just a few of the many ways your handiwork can be combined with some sexy conversation. Go ahead and whisper, growl, or even shout your praises to add an audio element to lovemaking.

Sex Talk Generator

(This is a little tongue-in-cheek humour! But still useful)

When it comes to things to say during sex, I feel like porn has let me down. I’ve been raised on these stock phrases:

“God you’re wet.”

“You like that, don’t you?”

“I like the way you stroke his cock.” ( Ha Ha! )

Have you noticed that the things said during sex rarely exceeds six or so words?

Something you will not hear in bed: “The sexual pleasure that I’m experiencing right now has exceeded my expectations. I’m so happy that we are having sex.”

Pg 223





Sex talk has to be short and to the point, so I’ve developed a handy Sex Talk Generator to help you out in the bedroom. I’ve kept in mind that the perfect sex talk statement contains three key ingredients:

 a Segue - something that says, “Okay get ready, I’m about to say something sexy!”

 a Descriptor - an honest take on the current situation

 a suggestion for future Action - a not-so-subtle announcement of what is going to happen next Simply take one thing from each column and then put it together.

1: Segues

2: Descriptions





3: Actions


- Fuck,


- you’re so big,

- don’t stop

- Oh my god,

- you’re so wet,

- do me harder

- Yesss,

- I love this,

- go slower

- Name of person,

- what are you doing,

- go faster

- Wait,

- what’s this red blob,

- pull my hair

- Ouch,

- spank me

- tie my hands

- get off me

- oh shit I think the condom broke

- get ready for my massive load

This truly EXCELLENT blog gives great insight into sex from a woman’s point of view and what goes through her mind, what turns her on (especially being dominated). This following post from the blog is a PERFECT

example of dominant dirty talk.

23 positions in a one night stand

I don't think I have ever had as many orgasms in one sitting as I had in the 12 hours I spent with SP a few nights ago. Truly amazing. I am still sore. And finding it a little difficult to walk. But a good price to pay for 20+

climaxes*...

We had a lovely evening actually, went out to dinner, watched a movie, talked. And of course had rampant sex.

Somehow we went from cuddling on his couch to me lying on my back with his cock down my throat, grabbing his ass whilst he fucked my mouth hard. I was torn between sticking my fingers in his asshole and rubbing myself between my legs. (Um, I chose the selfish option and opted for some self-pleasure). That didn't last long though: SP got off me, ripped my clothes off and shoved his fingers inside me till I came. Being the polite girl that I am, I didn't complain, not even when I had 4 more climaxes and was feeling exhausted. But the line was drawn when I was on orgasm number 7 and he still wouldn't let me have his cock inside me. I was almost crying out in desperation and felt infuriated. Finally though he gave it to me: he pulled me on top of him and slid himself into me. Needless to say number 8 arrived simultaneously and as soon as he started saying:

"Go on, go on, fuck my cock, go on you know you want it, fuck me hard", number 9 and 10 arrived pretty soon after. And when I felt SP begin to tense up and grip me even tighter, I held on for him; as soon as he began to explode, I let go. Our bodies shook in unison and we collapsed together in each other’s arms.

Later in bed SP got out the lube, rubbed it all over me. We had talked about fisting earlier in the evening and I Pg 224





know he was as eager as me to try it. And try it he did. I know at one point he was almost all the way in: it felt so amazing and so painful at the same time. And yes, I came over and over again. What I really enjoyed about it was how when his hand was inside me, it was like he owned my insides and I was his. And yet, I had his hand.

It was mine. And it was inside me. I owned him too. It was strangely binding and very intimate; not something one normally equates with ramming a fist (with some force) inside a vagina, but there you go: don't knock something til you've tried it...

I've noticed a difference in how I climax too. With SP I cum HARD. With incredible force (no wonder I get icepick headaches), my body tightens up and I even grind my teeth. (Odd I know). What is the weirdest thing, is that my pussy clenches so hard that I eject SP's cock. Now, I know he's not the largest guy, but full-on removal on climax? Not right. SP said my pussy was like a vice gripping his cock (which I guess is a compliment), but I found it very frustrating to lose his cock from inside me the very instant that I want him there; to be cumming with nothing inside me is a little disappointing. Anyway, once we figured out when my orgasm eject button was likely to happen, SP would grab me hard by the hips and say:

"Think you're gonna push my cock out now? Do you? My cock's gonna stay in. Go on, push it out. Go on. You can try, I ain't going anywhere. Go on. Slide against my cock, go on, fuck it", and of course that would make me cum fucking hard. But at least he would still be inside me...

We had some fantastic sex that night. Wow. It just gets better. Really. The chemistry between us is amazing.

And I don't just mean the sex. We are as intimate together now as when we were seeing each other a few months ago. So much of our physical contact is non-sexual and just tender. It’s hard to behave like a fuckbuddy with SP when he is stroking my hair, rubbing his nose against mine, and holding my hand. It's confusing when he tells me he split with the teenager just after I left him, that he has slept with no-one else since, but thought I had and that he misses me not living with him anymore. It's difficult when we are lying in each other’s arms after making love and he wants to know what I am thinking.

Stamina

So it’s not that often that I get so shagged beyond all recognition that all I want to do is drop off to sleep after climaxing. But it is possible – even for a girl like me: I had a fling with a marathon runner for a while - damn that boy had stamina. Stamina like you wouldn’t believe. One night – eight orgasms in - I actually had to beg him to stop.

With his cock sticking out like a fucking flagpole, I told him that I couldn’t physically fuck anymore. My body was ruined: I couldn’t move. I was well and truly fucked. I needed rest. And do you know what this sadistic bastard did? Stuck his tongue between my legs, ate me out until I was on the brink of another orgasm and then fucked me hard until I had had two more, saying ‘now I have fucked you good and proper’. Bastard.

G-GASM : THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO THE G-SPOT ORGASM

http://G-gasm.com

Third Base – Variations of the G-gasm Method

Say Hello to Lisa

Lisa, a petite blond with a cute little body, and I were at a friend’s party. At the time, we had only been going out for a very short time, and hadn’t yet reached second base.

I invited Lisa down to the basement to get away from everyone. We both had a few beers, and were feeling good. “Have you ever had a G-gasm?” I asked Lisa.

Pg 225

"G-gasm?" she asked, waiting for my reaction.

"G-gasms," I repeated playing dumb. “You know, a G-spot orgasm,” I explained.

Lisa tried to keep a blank face, hoping that I would reveal more information. Lisa and I had been going out for about a month, and our relationship was starting to become serious.

“I have never had an orgasm without my vibrator glued up against my clit,” Lisa confided.

I snuggled closer to her, nuzzling my lips to her face and mouth. I planted soft kisses under her chin and drew her eyes up to mine.

"What do you think?" I asked with a teasing voice that made her smile. “You want to try?”

Lisa pulled me closer to her, and drew her mouth close to mine. Her soft lips pressed hard against mine, and my tongue parted her lips as I explored her silky mouth.

Her nipples poked out from her t-shirt. I pinched them playfully, causing Lisa to let out a soft moan. I peeled away her shirt. Her bra concealed her beautiful breasts. Lisa reached back, undid the snap and let me get a glimpse of her milky white tits. Her bra straps slipped off her shoulders and the bra fell to the ground.

I plopped her down onto the floor and straddled her waist. My hands moved towards her to caress her cute little titties. Her nipples grew hard as I pinched them playfully. She reached under my shirt with both hands, and rubbed my smooth skin. She tickled me around my stomach, and started to fiddle with my belt to loosen my jeans.

I leaned down to kiss her, as she was bucking her hips upward to meet the growing bulge in my pants. She felt hot, excited, tingling.

My hands left her breasts and started making their way down to her waist. She moaned as I unbuttoned her jeans, and tugged at the zipper. I licked a trail down her chin and neck, touched her hard nipples with my hot tongue, and made my way down to her bikini line. She glided her pants down her legs and kicked them off onto the ground. Lisa’s underwear followed next, her sweet pussy exposed to the cool room. She had goose bumps all over her body.

With my tongue, I made my way down to her pussy.

"Oh, god," she whimpered, pushing my head into her cunt, moaning as I licked her tight opening.

I reached around her and grabbed her round cheeks, squeezing them and pulling her sweet pussy towards my face. She wrapped both legs around my shoulders and thrust her hips towards me. With my tongue, I hungrily reached into her pussy as deep as I could. Executing the best cunnilingus skills I could muster she whispered,

"You are so great … You are the best ever, you know that?"

“Yes, baby," I answered. “Now she’s ready for some G-gasm action,” I thought to myself. I smiled, my eyes focused on her snatch, I reached up to stroke her tits and give he nipples a firm squeeze to really get her going.

Her pussy was so hot and wet. I slid my finger down her slit and back up again, Lisa let out a little whimper. I let my finger dive right in up to the knuckle. I rotated my finger around in a circle and then pulled it out, positioning myself where Lisa could see me, I slowly licked off my finger. I liked the way she tasted; I licked my finger clean. Then I let my finger dive and dip in and out repeatedly.

Pg 226





Finally, I reached in, found the G-spot and gave it the ol’ “come here” motion. Lisa was ready; her G-spot was the size of a nice plump pea. Inside my mouth, Lisa’s clit was growing crimson with excitement, and the sweet bump of her G-spot was plump and bloated on my fingertip as her love juices gathered.

With my finger, I rubbed her G-spot spot, trying out different degrees of pressure and adding some variety to my rubbing. Soon, Lisa would lose control and then the sweetness would overcome her... she wanted it, yearning for the huge release to finish her off. Finally, she exploded. Lisa lost control and came all over my hand. I gave her 30 seconds to regain her composure, and then started rubbing again.

Lisa looked up at me with this look of pure panic and excitement – she was losing control. I continued rubbing.

I felt her fingernails start to dig into my arms as she pushed her hips towards my inserted hand. I knew it was just moments before she would G-gasm again. I rubbed faster and furiously.

Her moaning and thrashing was getting increasingly louder which was a turn on for me. "I'm going to cum!"

She yelled. She started shaking as she threw her head back and screamed. “OOOooooowww,” she shuddered and whimpered.

I removed my finger from her hole and replaced it with my tongue. Lisa was flowing with love juices. I reached in her pussy as far as I could. She was so sweet. I continued licking her until she started squirming again. I reinserted my finger and found her G-spot - swollen to the size of a quarter - perfect.

"No, no, no, not again," Lisa whimpered as she tried to wiggle away.

“Oh yeah, Baby … one more time,” I said as I started rubbing her G-spot with one hand, and placed my other hand over her stomach to prevent her from squirming away. I always try to make the lady submit just a little longer than she wants to.

Lisa started screaming and begging me to stop. She loved it and hated it at the same time. She loved it because it felt so good, but hated it because I was in total control. Unless you know there is real pain – give them one more when they tell you to stop.

You Are So Naughty

Add in a little BDSM activities during your G-Spot marathon – Olive’s favorite. This will really heat things up.

A few well-placed spankings with your hand or a paddle will do. In addition to this, tie her down and control how many G-gasms she has! What a nice little mixture – the kinkiness of a G-spot rubbing together with a little bit of submissiveness – awesome. Be careful, this might be too intense for some women. “Don’t you dare try and wriggle away from me – OK …WHACK … now you get another G-gasm!” I shouted, “You’ll like it if I tell you to like it!”

Olive moaned softly. I did it again. Her pussy got wetter – my thumb was sliding like a well-oiled piston in her pussy. Olive craved some light spankings. She loved it, and wiggled her ass to encourage more. I spanked her even harder, watching her ass get redder and redder.

Up until a few months earlier, I had no idea about how hot spankings could really be. Olive changed all that.

Olive was not her real name, to tell you the truth; I do not even remember her real name. I will never forget her though. She was a thin Mexican beauty with dark brown hair. Besides the hair on her head and her eyebrows, she did not have a strand of hair on her body – right down to her lovable little pussy. I think that is why I nicknamed her Olive. One day, Olive and I were in a bar having a drink and chatting.

Pg 227

“The other day I was at a spanking blog, as I read a few posts, my pussy got so fucking wet. Normally I would just masturbate, but something inside my head snapped. I thought to myself that it is time to stop reading and imagining, it was time to turn some of my fantasies into reality,” Olive confided.

I was not very shocked that Olive was suggesting that I tie her up and spank her. I knew she was kinky and fucking horny as hell. Now, I’m a nice guy, I don’t go around beating the crap out of people – unless of course they deserve it – so I told her I was a little afraid of hurting her.

Olive convinced me that this is something that she really wanted. We agreed to try it – total domination intrigues me. We finished our drinks, and headed for the local hardware store for some duct tape.

We got to my place. "How hard should I spank you?" I asked Olive.

"I don't really know. I have never done this. I guess hit me hard enough to really experience the sensation of my ass being on fire," Olive replied.

"How many spankings should I give you?" I asked. I had not thought about that.

“Let's see what happens. Keep going until either I can't handle any more or your hand gets tired," Olive replied.

“OK – cool. The “out word” is “uncle.”

“What is an “out” word,” Olive asked.

“A word you say, that immediately stops all activities. Just in case you are screaming “stop, stop,” but really mean “more, more.” When you say “uncle” that’s it – no more,” I explained.

Olive agreed that this sounded like a good plan. “Start light and work your way up,” Olive advised.

No problem, I had some big plans for her. “Where and to what should I duct tape her,” I thought to myself. My bed was just a mattress, no backboard, so that would not work. Looking around the den, I spotted the entertainment center. Perfect, I can run the tape around the legs and back to her wrists.

“Put your wrists together,” I demanded. Olive complied, I wrapped the tape around her wrists and told her to get on her knees and lean forward onto her elbows. I stretched the tape around the entertainment center’s leg, then back around her wrists a few times, then once again around the leg.

Olive was able to move her legs, but her hands and arms were completely restrained. Olive closed her eyes. I could tell she was very nervous, yet also very sexually aroused. I wanted to see if the pleasure and pain thing was for real. I rubbed her ass a few times until I could not take the anticipation anymore.

I lightly tapped her bare bottom. With each whack, my stroke grew stronger. Olive’s body was starting to gyrate and rock back and forth. She was enjoying it … I was enjoying it.

“Wow this is incredible,” I thought to myself. After a couple of hard strokes, I stuck my thumb in her pussy.

She let out a groan. Her pussy was dripping wet. I could not believe it; besides spanking, I had not even touched her yet.

"Your clit is throbbing and that sweet little cunt is dripping wet, isn't it?" Olive nodded, her breathing ragged.

Pg 228





I started to rub her already engorged G-spot with one hand and continue to punish her with the other. Her pussy was flowing like a river.

Olive screamed in pain when I spanked her even harder. Finally, it was too much for her, and she yelled,

"STOP!"

I knew this really meant, “GO!” So, I continued the rubbing and smacking. Olive was rocking back furiously –

she was almost ready to explode. A few more slaps landed on her now red ass, she was trembling. She begged me to let her cum, “Rub harder, please, make me cum.” She cried.

I whispered, “You ready to come baby?”

I let out a silent chuckle at my horny little FB. Olive let out a muffled scream of relief, warm watery liquid gurgled out from between her thighs. I leaned over and licked all the way up to her pussy, licking up all those sweet love juices.

I could not take it anymore. I unzipped my pants and let my now raging hard-on see the daylight. What a sight. I mounted Olive from behind and started pumping away.

I slowly pumped in and out, knowing how good this was feeling as my dick massaged her warm, slippery inner walls, especially the G-spot.

“Come on baby. Fuck me like you mean it.”

It was not long before my thrusts grew harder and faster bringing Olive to yet another G-gasm. She wanted more. “Yeah baby. Fuck my little cunt. Shoot your cum inside me!”

“You like this baby girl.” I moaned jamming my hard cock inside her.

“Yes. I like it! I like it! Keep fucking me – harder - harder! ” She panted, rocking back and forth against me.

I teased her a little bit, slowing down, pulling out, then pushing in hard again. I gave her a few swift slaps on her ass making her fuck me deeper and harder.

“I’m gunna cum!” I screamed out.

“Yes. Shoot your hot load deep inside my pussy!”

Olive was ready to cum again. Her pussy was clenching down on my cock. She threw her head back, we both exploded together.

“You’re beautiful when you cum baby.” I whispered.

“Uncle,” Olive said softly.

Foreplay Techniques

Dirty talking

Never underestimate the power of words to turn on your partner. Imagine looking into your partner's eyes over dinner at a nice restaurant and whispering, “You look so sexy tonight I can barely keep my hands off of you.”

Pg 229





You can even follow it up with a description of what you'd like to do to her. For example, you might say,

“When we get home, I'm going to slowly undress you, lay you down on the bed, and give you the best full body massage you've ever had.” This kind of comments will make your partner feel desirable and that will increase her arousal, plus she'll be able to start fantasizing about how your hands are going to feel caressing her body and that's definitely going to build her anticipation for more. Just remember that you need to follow through with whatever you say. If you promise her an amazing massage, then you need to deliver. Women are not turned on by promise breakers.

Chapter 5 - Interesting Facts About Sex

The single biggest sexual complaint MEN have about women!

This one is very simple: Men want women to be enthusiastic about having sex. Men’s biggest complaint is their sexual partners seem to be "enduring" their sexual activities as opposed to actually enjoying them.

Again… if you treat sex as a reward for yourself… it will be denied you. Instead… make sex as a reward for her good behaviour. Tease her. Give it to her… then take it away.

Plant ideas in her head.

If you want her to be more aggressive… be suggestive.

Tease.

Tell her what’s going to happen.

For example: “Sweetheart, tomorrow night, I’m going to gently bite your legs all over… gently… for twenty minutes… maybe thirty minutes. Gently. Be prepared.” This will hit her subconscious mind like a truck. She will be bumping into walls until the next night.

If you plant these ideas into her subconscious and she does not act more aggressive, at least she will be more responsive to you.

Getting it on Like a Lesbian: A How-To Guide (Chapter 1)

The second way to figure out what a woman enjoys in the sack is to ask. No, I’m not suggesting that you call your girlfriend up and tell her you want to meet for coffee to discuss what makes her come. However, communication is key to all aspects of a relationship, and sex is no exception. You can use this to your advantage by talking dirty to her in bed.

Dirty talk can be tricky, because you don’t want to freak her out or make her laugh at you. I find the best way to get a girl to open up is to ask her questions. Ask her if she likes the way you’re touching her or to describe to you what she wants you to do next. Hell, ask her if she wants to get on the dining table. This is also really handy anytime your mouth is pre-occupied. I know hearing her tell you that the way you blank her blank is ridiculously hot, but FOCUS on what she’s telling you she wants you to do! It’s like having GPS navigation for her vagina.

WARNING: If your lady does not talk to you openly about her body, now is not the time to launch in to “Your pussy is so hot”. Dirty talk is incredibly effective, but you have to warm up to it slowly. If she refers to her naughty bits as “down there”, follow suit.

The more info you can get about what gets a girl off, the better. She’s not going to realize that you didn’t know that stuff about her already. She’s just going to think you’re incredible in bed.

Talking Dirty

Your initial reaction to this phrase may be a negative one; after all it is loaded with negative connotations.

Nevertheless, the use of explicit descriptions in sex play can be extremely beneficial. They allow us to get in touch with our carnal passions and can be a healthy expression of our sexual desires. Most importantly we can use explicit words and phrases to enrich our sex lives adding a new dimension to our sexual expressiveness.

How to start ‘Talking Dirty’ :

Pg 231





Although the idea of talking dirty may be incredibly exciting for you, your partner may have a different reaction. It is important to approach the topic in a sensitive manner so your partner doesn't think you've gone mad.

A nice way to introduce explicit sexual talk is by responding to your partner. When she/he is massaging your genitals you may want to respond with phrases like:

"Honey, it feels so good when you rub my cock that way. Thanks for being such a wonderful lover."

"My clit is pulsating, you know how to rub me the right way."

When introducing sexually explicit talk try to couple it with reassuring or tender words. This will help take some of the edge off these words that many people can find troubling or a turnoff. See how your partner reacts to such prompting. You may discover that some words are perfectly acceptable to the two of you while others should be kept out of the bedroom. If you partner does not seem to be responding then you may want to involve them in another way.

When pleasuring your partner you may want to ask some questions to just get him/her talking. For instance you may want to ask whether it is more pleasurable when you "rub your clit" or "massage your nipples". A simple yes or no answer will do. Getting your partner to talk is an important beginning. It is much easier to explore the topic when you have a partner who is willing to communicate. Then you can ask them what they would like. If they are still shy then continue asking them.

Remember some people may be uncomfortable with these words so be considerate of your partner's wishes.

SEXHEALTH.ORG

Use Your Words

Remember that awful old saying "girls should be seen and not heard"? In my opinion, that's rubbish. In this day and age, it's definitely the vocal girl who gets ahead. This applies not only to everyday life, but to the bedroom as well. Injecting some sassy dirty talk into your sex life is sure to heat things up. More importantly, being able to seductively speak to your lover will get you exactly what you want, when you want it. Girls, and guys for that matter, the time has come to embrace the Chatty Kathy within!

The best way to approach dirty talk is to regard it as something that will turn your lover on and help them pleasure you as well. Wild words are definitely multi-purpose in this sense. What you say and how you say it depends on your overall comfort level with the whole concept of talking dirty. Your bedroom dialogue doesn't necessarily have to be "dirty" per se. You can talk during sex without having to have your mouth washed out afterwards. For the tongue-tied sisters out there, I suggest that you keep it nice and simple. When your lover is doing something that turns you on, let them know. Saying things like "I really enjoy when you kiss me there" or

"It feels great when you touch me like that" are good ways to introduce a little word play into your sex routine.

Your lover will be pleased that they are pleasuring you and excited by the sound of your sexy voice. They will also have a better sense of what gets your juices flowing, something which will be beneficial to both of you in future sessions.

If you're a fearless filly by nature, step it up a notch. Be explicit when you talk to your lover. Using "naughty"

words for body parts, as opposed to the anatomical definitions, is generally forbidden in social contexts. In the bedroom, however, it's no holds barred! You have the ultimate freedom to be as dirty, daring and detailed as you want. If you're comfortable using raunchy words, by all means, get your verbal jiggy on! Another thing you can try is calling, screaming, or simply saying your lover's name while in the midst of a passionate round of sex.

Most men find this to be an incredible turn on, and the more you turn him on, the more likely he is to want to knock your socks off!

Watch Your Language

What do you say when you're having sex? What sounds do you make? Are you dirty? Filthy? Kinky? Do you pretend you're a high-priced call girl or the sex-crazed cabana boy? Do you beg for it? Are you the boss? Or do you say absolutely nothing at all?

If you find yourself sexually speechless, let me suggest a few ways to get your tongue wagging and your heart thumping.

We all need positive re-enforcement in the bedroom. Nothing boosts your confidence like knowing you're pushing all the right buttons. If you're too shy to start dirty talking right away, initiate by moaning and groaning.

Heavy breathing can also convey an important message. A little hitched breath, sounds like pure pleasure. We're in our animal primal state while we're having sex....so why not sound like a jungle cat?

Compliments are so easy to give and go such a long way. Tell your man you adore his member -that it's huge, or smooth or hard. This one's a giveaway, girls. Ladies love to hear that they've got a smokin' ass, or that they've got silky skin. Customize. There are things that attract you to your mate. Let them know what those things are. Start with the eyes, the hair, the muscle tone and move on to more sexual features.

Take the guesswork out of sex, by giving concise directions. Tell your honey where exactly you want their hands, tongue etc, and with what degree force should be applied. Let them know how what they are doing feels, when to repeat and how fast etc. You'll be taken aback at how quickly your mechanical instructions turn into

"Ride me like a wild Bull in the Rodeo Championships" or "Pound me like a Jackhammer."

A final stage of the gradually escalating bedroom banter ends in theatrics. Once you've suitably warmed up to the idea of setting your oral inhibitions loose, consider role play. It offers the opportunity to be someone you're not. This can be exhilarating. Some scenarios I love are: Strangers on a One-Night Stand, Hiring your Partner for sex - you also get to be very instructive in this role or Family Pets in the Garage - just kidding.

Start where you're comfortable. Be sure that your partner is comfortable as well. And push your limits gradually. You'll be glad you did.

Secret to a successful 2nd orgasm...

Step 1

Go to your local "adult" shop and buy a $5 tongue vibrator. Maybe get 2 of them in different colours for different jobs. They are tiny plastic bullet vibes with a "rubber band" that hold them on your tongue.

Step 2

As the action gets hot and heavy, excuse yourself to the bathroom to "clean up" Once there, masturbate so you won’t be so likely to pre-maturely ejaculate.

Pg 233





Step 3

Bring your woman to orgasm.

Anyone here who learns the simple techniques won’t have a problem doing it once, and since you masturbated, you won’t be in such a hurry to "drop a load"

Step 4

Put the tongue vibrator onto your penis, about 1/2 way down the shaft with the bullet facing down, then insert it into your woman doggie style.

Step 5

Don’t pump it, just have your woman slowly scoot forward until she is lying on her belly with her butt ever so slightly stuck up in the air. This allows you to keep your penis in her. It also places the vibrator in direct contact with the most sensitive areas of her anatomy. Specifically the G-spot and back side of her clit.

Step 6

Now, with her lying face down, and you on your knees inside her from behind, sort of straddling her, put a liberal amount of heating oil or massage oil on her back. Using your best back massaging techniques, work up and down her back with your hands. Ask her to tell you when you get to those "spots" on her back that make her tingle. Make mental notes of where those spots are, and every time you pass over them, take an extra second or two to give them special attention.

The gentle rocking motion of you working up and down her back will move the vibe 1/4 to 1/2 an inch inside her. The sensation will begin to excite you as well. If it does, just stop rocking your pelvis and concentrate on her "sensitive spots".

After a couple minutes of this, she will start to respond. Be sure to tell her you are about to unload as well.

Talk dirty to her, scratch her back with your fingernails, smack her ass, pull her hair, whatever turns her on...

She will start to squirm, tell her "I want you to come" in a dirty powerful voice. SHE WILL COME HARD!

Then you can rock your pelvis to "pump her" and get your cookies!!!

Guide to dirty talk?

USER : StuffGuyDude

So my girlfriend is really shy, and as such isn't too great at "dirty talk" in the bedroom. She likes to dress up in costumes (schoolgirl, cheerleader, Halloween costumes, etc) while we do our thing and pretend she's whatever she's dressed as, but as for conveying that with words and generally just acting/talking "naughty" for lack of a better term, she's admittedly not very good at it. I've tried to give her some tips, but they just haven't really sunk in, and she responds really well to reading articles about these types of things.

So I was wondering if anyone had any ebooks/blogs/articles on bedroom roleplaying and talking dirty, specifically geared towards the ladies. Thanks in advance!

USER : dddave

I don't have a link to share, but I can tell you that I simply showed my wife my example. When she did let something nasty out of her mouth in the bedroom, I just made sure I let her know that it was a turn-on to me.

When we first met, she was very reserved about dirty talk but now she says things like "Fuck me harder," or even "Fill me with your cum." She shocks me sometimes... in a good way.

Pg 234

We did have a conversation on the first night we slept together where I told her some important things: (1) Good sex is messy, loud, fun and sometimes embarrassing, and (2) Outside the bedroom, it's okay to call it a penis or vagina, but in bed it's a cock or pussy, and (3) It's not only OK, but recommended that we can use the

"F" word to describe what we're doing... it doesn't always have to be romantic.

USER : Strange Famous

If she doesn’t like to swear I don’t see the value in trying to encourage her, unless you are somehow especially excited by bad language.

I know that if for example my girlfriend starting calling people "cunt" or "cuntie" and saying "fuck" every other sentence (as I talk unfortunately) I wouldn’t exactly be excited about it... not that I could criticize her over it, as I am very foul mouthed and inarticulate myself.

Not quite what I was talking about, though maybe I wasn't too clear in my post. She has no aversion to saying things along the lines of "I'm your dirty little slut, fill me with your hot cum," etc. The issue is that when we're having sex, she doesn't really say those things because she just doesn't know what to say, when to say it, etc. I was hoping to maybe find some articles or some books specifically about being more open with this kind of thing. She's the kind of person that's nervous that she's going to do something "wrong" and offend me, and I’ve told her that I’m perfectly comfortable with the fact that she might not get it "right," the important thing is that she just lets loose and goes with whatever comes to mind, but these sorts of things never really sink in unless she reads about them. I've found a handful of ebooks specifically about "talking dirty" in the bedroom, but they're all the "here's two paragraphs, for just $35.99 you can read the rest and have the BEST SEX OF YOUR

LIFE!!!!" scams.

Dumb question... how old are you?

Sometimes this stuff comes with time.

And if your lover can say "I'm your dirty little slut" you are not doing too badly.

If she's awkward at times, then you have to know there is no manual for her to read.

Just be the best lover you can be, encourage her to do the things you like, and don't expect too much.

USER : Strange Famous

I don’t know about it. In my life I've never known a real woman say "I'm your dirty little slut, fill with me with hot cum"... I'd be quite taken aback if any girl I was with said it, I think stuff like that only happens in porno movies - but perhaps I've had a sheltered life?

I don’t think any article is going to tell you of things like this in any case... maybe the best thing is just to not concentrate too much on the details and just try to both do what comes naturally. If she feels like she is putting on a performance maybe that’s why she feels reticent about it... personally I have always found concentrating on things like that creates more pressure and it’s more fun for both people to just feel open and confident enough to do what they feel.

But I would ask - without trying to being critical about it - what it is about having your girlfriend run herself down with negative comments like calling herself a slut that is appealing?

You are absolutely right, vulgar language in everyday life is just that - vulgar. My feeling though is that IN

BED, that language has its place. If my wife were to say "Put your penis in my vagina" I would be very tuned off. When she (and she is a very conservative person) says "Fuck me now," it makes me crazy with desire for her

USER : Strange Famous

I agree that something like "put your penis in my vagina" would sound strange and unattractive.

I might, I suppose, if I was in a certain mood, say something like "I want to fuck you immediately" although it is unlikely, but personally I wouldn’t feel happy to hear my girlfriend call herself a dirty slut as mentioned in other posts.

If my girlfriend said "fuck me now" I might quite like that kind of assertiveness If she said "I’m a slut" I'd feel kind of bad that she was talking negatively about herself.

But everyone is different and has different buttons, if two people find something pleasurable it's all good as long as no harm is being done.

USER : Lady Bear Cub

I'm usually making too much noise to actually talk during sex. If something slips out, it's usually "fuck me like that" or "fuck me harder" and that's pretty much already been covered by previous posts.

As for role playing dirty talk.. I think that needs to just come naturally. I don't think you can really teach it.

Maybe if she reads some dirty books it will give her some ideas of what to say. Dirty books are loaded with that type of stuff.

I disagree. When I was younger I didn't talk much during sex. I think it's necessary to be comfortable with your own sexuality and know what turns you, and your partner, on before talking dirty feels right. Now I like to talk about what feels good for me, or fantasies I have, while we fuck. It feels natural now, but I had to work at being comfortable sharing my "dirty thoughts". In that sense, I taught myself it was okay to be a dirty girl for the sake of better sex.

Yes you have. There are actually quite a few of us who've said those words and more outside of porn.

To the OP...I sort of agree with the others. It isn't something you can learn from a book or really something you can teach. There has to be a basic comfort-level that can take some people years or even decades to develop.

She's already got an idea of what you want and will likely get only more awkward instead of less if you push.

The best thing to do is respond enthusiastically when she does say something.

You can alsofind some porn or erotica with the language you like. Let her watch/read and comment how the language turns you on.

USER : StuffGuyDude

While I thank everyone for the advice, I still don’t think I’ve quite conveyed the issue correctly. I'm in no way trying to push or force her to do something she isn't comfortable doing. She's 100% a-ok with talking dirty in the bedroom, she's not shy or uncomfortable about it. The issue is that she has absolutely no experience with actually doing it, and therefore is looking for tips on dirty talking technique (ideas of what to say, voice inflection, what not to say, etc).

To draw a parallel, the situation is exactly like if she was ready and willing to say, give a blowjob, but she's never done it before and doesn't want to hurt the man. So she would read one of the million "guide to amazing sex" books or "how to give your man a great blowjob" blogs/articles to learn more about how to give a blowjob the man will enjoy. We're looking for resources like those columns/books, except about talking dirty in bed instead of blowjobs.

Tell her if she isn't sure about saying something, to use a husky whisper in your ear. No worries about inflection and it's just as hot.

Thanks for all the discussion in this thread, but I found exactly what we were looking for in "Talk Sexy To the One You Love: And other secrets for improving communication" By Barbara Keesling. You can find it at pretty much any online book retailer for $10-15, buy the .pdf straight from the authors website for about the same price, or (if it’s your thing) find the pdf floating around ebook sharing websites (which I will not be providing links to). It's written specifically towards women who want to learn how to talk dirty in the bedroom in both fun and erotic ways, with a strong emphasis on creating a no-pressure environment. It's based around 50 or so small exercises designed to help her be more confident about her body and saying these types of things in the bedroom. Sometimes it's a little to "self-helpey" for my taste, but I showed it to my girlfriend and she thinks its exactly what she needs and is excited to give it a try. I'd suggest anyone interested in this kind of thing to get their hands on a copy, and for those of you who said you don't understand the appeal, give it a once-over, even if it's just to try to better understand why people enjoy this kind of thing.

I have to say in response to Strange Famous, it really turns me on when my husband calls me a dirty whore or a fucking slut. But he was my first and I was his. Outside the bedroom we're Mr and Mrs Nice, Straight and Clean. Inside the walls of our bedroom I want to be his whore, as dirty as I possibly can be and I want to hear him tell me how dirty and bad I am.

Bedroom Bad

Has your girlfriend's shyness put a spoke in the wheel of your erotic yearnings? Here's how to release the sexual dynamo lurking beneath that prim goody-two-shoes persona.

Your woman is so stuck on the missionary position, you're sure you could convert Marilyn Manson. Perhaps she prefers lying on her back because it makes her stomach look flatter. More likely you've landed yourself a shy girl. Not that there's anything wrong with that; you'd take a timid tigress over a yowling yeti any day, especially one in a miniskirt who enjoys rugby and thinks Eminem rocks.

Truth is, the two of you mesh in all the right ways except between the sheets. Oh, she's good in bed all right. So good she could join a convent. A quick perusal of her Shape magazine and then it's lights out. Fumble on, party animal. If there is a vixen inside that virtuous exterior, it's hibernating in its lair. Unleashing the hounds with a blast of your hunting bugle will prove futile. It's time to change tactics Mr Lover Lover.

Taking the sexual initiative with a Bashful Brenda is rather like trying to tame a skittish gazelle. Startle her too soon and she'll bolt. Your best approach is to tempt and cajole her. Display the bait then lie low for a while. Let her graze on the lush plains of her own fertile imagination. Let her think she's striding into your erotic hinterland and annexing a piece of the action all for herself. Allowing her to take the reins in the bedroom could pay rich dividends. You might find yourself on all fours playing bucking stallion to her riding crop but if she's shy, this is unlikely: at least until she gets used to her newfound power.

If you want her to veer off the well-travelled terrain of your ho-hum love life, you'll have to unleash her inner beast. Give her compliments she can chew over. Revere her body in such a way that she begins to revel in her newfound sexuality. Once she gets hip to the virtues of variety she'll starts improvising on her own faster than you can say: “I'll go and get the saddle.” Timing is everything. Good lighting is essential too. And if you're a little shy yourself, take heart. There are ways of getting your erotic needs met without losing face. You too can take your woman from uptight to up-for-anything if you exercise a little patience and take a few pointers from other women whose men have led them into temptation.

Talk her into a smutty conversation

Nothing breaks the mood like having to check for a heartbeat in the middle of your fine performance. Is she bored? Wondering where her old photo album is? Trying to decide between concrete or parquet flooring in the guest cottage? Is she even awake? Help her move from silent to salacious by letting out a few moans and groans of your own. Then open up a conversation. Start small: ask her yes-or-no questions like: “Do you like that?”

“Does that feel good?” Tell her how horny she's making you feel but take your verbal cues from her. Don't use four-letter words until she does.

“I'd dated Paul a few times and one night it was pretty obvious we would make love. As we were kissing, he started describing how my body made him feel. He used very specific - and spicy - language about which parts of my body he wanted to kiss until I felt myself getting very hot and bothered indeed. Suddenly he whispered in my ear: ‘Talk to me. Just tell me how you feel, what you want.' I was nervous that I'd sound silly, but after dating so many guys interested only in their own pleasure, Paul's urgings felt like a breath of fresh air.

I tentatively chimed in with: ‘I love it when you nibble my earlobes and run your hands through my hair.' We took turns saying what we wanted, getting more daring as we went along. Every time I said something naughty, he groaned softly or held me tighter, reinforcing how excited it made him feel. Afterwards he asked me if I'd minded talking to him like that. To be honest, I felt shy at first but it got us both so excited. I've taken to surprising Paul with the odd phone call at work.”

Establish Your Sex Dictionary

“Sexy talk in bed can be a big turn-on—unless she’s turned off by your language. So play a game: Find a magazine with nude pictures and point to body parts, asking her, ‘What do you want me to call that? A vagina, a pussy, or something else?’ Then tell her whether you have a cock, a penis, or a trouser monkey.” —Carol Queen, owner of San Francisco sex toy and book emporium Good Vibrations Encourage Her Wild Side

“Nice girls worry that if they get wild in bed, you’ll think of them as sluts. So I say this: If you’re lucky enough to have wild, risqué sex with your girlfriend, make sure to be particularly romantic afterward. If she dresses up naughty for you or gets kinky and spanks you, say, ‘I love you for that,’ and caress her hair while you say it.

The wilder the sexcapade is, the more romantic you need to be afterward so she knows that you still think she’s a nice girl deep down. She’ll be bloody up for everything then!” —Tracey Cox, author of Superflirt JOAN ELIZABETH LLOYD - LOVERS' FEEDBACK FORUM

My boyfriend wants me to talk dirty to him in bed

My boyfriend keeps asking me to talk dirty to him during sex, but I have no idea what to say. Do you have any suggestions?

Whether you're saying something sensual, making raunchy remarks or sharing a wild fantasy, you don't want your carnal comments to sound forced, so just share the sexy thoughts that pop into your mind rather than trying to rack your brain for something racy. And remember, you don't need to talk the entire session, let alone every time you're doing the deed.

Conquer your nerves by starting simple. Tell your guy that you like the way he's touching you, saying something like "It feels so good when you stroke me like that." Try complimenting his body or telling him what you want him to do to you ("Lick my nipples," "I want you inside me," "Thrust deeper," etc.). You may even find that voicing your desires can make the encounter more intense for you, too.

If you're really tongue-tied and can't think of anything to say, turn the tables and let him take the lead by asking what he wants to do to you or what you should do to him. Then you can take your cue from his lusty lingo and respond with some titillating talk of your own. After a few sessions like this, I bet your bedroom bantering skills will be top-notch.

Dirty Talking

I enjoy talking smut, not so much for the sake of saying naughty things as for the feeling of being skilled at it, or for the delight of being with someone who says sexy things. It is a pretty simple thrill, as most anything a lover says with sexy intentions works out to be exciting (barring unexpected and disconcerting fetishes or ideas, if that sort of thing makes you uncomfortable). Say something sexy, make your lover purr, feel like a fox, make them feel foxy for being with you. Hooray!

I don't think I have any particular habitual smutty things that I say. Boy and I have ongoing jokes and so on, but other than that I mostly go with my moment-specific inspirations. These can be playful, or snuggly, or murmur-y, or blunt, or in a more "I am intense and won't break the sexy eye contact" vein, or any number of other styles.

They can have a conspiratorial "want to be naughty with me?" premise, or a less elitist, more appreciative one (I am a bit of a hippie and used to being a nerd and I have a thing for not making yourself feel cool by excluding other people). Usually body contact is involved in the talk. It seems to me that I tend toward particular styles for when I am being sexy for fun, and for when I am actually a randy pants, but I can't think of what they are. If I do I'll report back.

….

The naughtiness of talk between special boy and I saw a fairly dramatic increase when we started using the word "fuck." Previous to that, we spoke passionately to each other in a way that was seductive, sensual, romantic even. The appearance of Fuck on the scene ushered in the purely sexual dirty talk. I like having the whole spectrum available.

9 Erotic Tips to Rock Your World — and His

Before You're Anywhere Near the Bedroom

 "Most men like it when a woman takes the initiative. Why not send him an erotic e-mail? In very specific detail, tell him how much you desire him and what you'll do to him the minute he comes home.

If you're sending the message to his work computer, make sure no one else can open his email!"

o

Judy Kuriansky, PhD, author of The Complete Idiot's Guide to a Healthy Relationship (Alpha, 1997) and radio host of the nationally syndicated show Love Phones A Little Bit Kinky

 "Call him — even if he's in the same house — and have great phone sex. The safety of not looking each other in the eye allows both of you to tell each other things you might be embarrassed to say when you're face-to-face. When you get him on the line, tell him how hot you're getting just thinking about his penis. Hearing someone describe how she or he is feeling and reacting is a huge turn-on."

o

Sue Johanson

 "For most guys, lusty talk is a turn-on. You can start off lightly — say, 'I love feeling your tongue there'

— and slowly escalate to using four-letter words. If you're wondering how a partner might react to explicit sex talk, ask him. Say, 'Sometimes when we're making love, I just feel like yelling out some dirty words, but I don't know how you'd react.' If you want him to join in, tell him: 'It really turns me on if I hear some down-and-dirty sex talk from you — are you okay with that?'"

How to Make a Steamy Connection

Even if your man is out of reach, it's still possible to have a hot night together. Achieving the ultimate in aural satisfaction is just a phone call away.

Want to know how to have phone sex? Achieving the ultimate in aural satisfaction is just a phone call away.

Pssst ... wanna know a naughty little secret? Spicing up your sex life doesn't have to involve elaborate new mattress moves. All you need to do is pick up the phone. "If you want to turn your man on like never before --

whether you're in a long-distance relationship or not -- phone sex is the perfect opportunity," says Gloria G.

Brame, Ph.D., author of Come Hither. And according to a Cosmo survey, 85 percent of men want their women to make that carnal call. Why? It lets you test the limits of each other's turn-ons "so you can dabble in acts that you may be too intimidated to try in person," says Brame. Ready to master the art of aural sex? Read on to learn how to press all the right buttons.

Before you dial, dim the lights, sip some wine or curl up with a dirty novel, says Anne Hooper, author of Great Sex Games. Once your libidinous juices are flowing, craft the perfect erotic icebreaker. If it's your first time attempting lust on the line, a simple phrase such as "I wish you were lying here with me" will get his mind wandering. Or inspire randy thoughts by reminiscing about a sizzling sack session you two have shared. Since you premeditated this sexy scenario, you may be more aroused than your guy. Bring him up to your level by making him feel like he's there with you. "Tell him explicitly how you're undressing," says Brame. "Reveal that you've sprayed the coconut-scented perfume he loves all over your tummy. Paint a picture for him so you can truly enjoy the experience in sync."

The most engaging ear candy is intensely personal. So ditch the phonesex-operator scripted dialogue. Honing in on what makes your man unique keeps it real, as Colleen,* 25, discovered. "Jason has muscular thighs, so I whispered that I was imagining the weight of his strong legs pressing against me with each thrust. His groans let Pg 241





me know that he was turned on by what I was describing." Next, encourage him to reveal what he's dying to do to you. One way to coax out these dirty desires is by asking questions, such as "Do you want to kiss my breasts?" Posing queries is also a good tactic if you're looking for a kinkier conversation. Selena, 27, led her boyfriend Jack down a lustier path by asking, "'How would you feel if I tied you up?' When he said he'd enjoy that, I described taking off my bra and using the straps to secure his arms." Says Brame: "Things you may be too inhibited to ask face-to-face suddenly start to roll off your tongue."

When the torrid talk reaches a boiling point, take matters into your own hands ... literally. "Having phone sex without mutual masturbation is like cooking a meal and not allowing yourself the pleasure of eating it," says Brame. Think of the advantages: You're indulging in a sex act with him, but you're free to touch yourself exclusively. Encourage him to give you instructions about where and how your hands should wander. And ask how he's stimulating his own bod. Not only will you hang up with a smile on your face, but you'll also be better able to satisfy each other when you get frisky in the flesh.

Sending erotic messages from one cell phone to another is a racy rage overseas, and now it's hitting our shores.

In Europe, one in four mobile users admit to dabbling in typed foreplay. So if you want to turn him on -- but you're in public, where your lips should be sealed -- page him your passionate thoughts.

How to Sound Sexy in the Sack

The hottest ways to mmmoan, gasp, and talk seductively between the sheets...it's all in our guide.

How to talk dirty:

Guys love carnal communication, but the vocals that turn them on the most vary. A past Cosmo sex poll found that 52 percent of men are moved by moans and sighs, while 37 percent dig outright dirty talk. "The key is to determine what you feel good doing and what your man wants to hear, then work from there," says Aline P.

Zoldbrod, Ph.D., sex therapist and author of Sex Talk: Uncensored Exercises for Exploring What Really Turns You On. "Even just some heavy breathing can make sex more mind-blowing." There's no need to consult the Spice channel for tutelage; just follow our easy manual.

Put yourself into the right mindset. Listen to tunes that turn you on, read racy fiction or conjure up steamy scenarios involving you and your dude. Do some deep breathing and let your body totally relax. Then experiment with sounds you could utter the next time you're in the sack. (Hey, you're solo here, so no worries about coming off lame.) "People don't realize that being vocal in bed isn't just about personality; it's also about practicing," says Regena Thomashauer, author of Mama Gena's Owner's and Operator's Guide to Men.

Now bring your sultry sounds to the bedroom. Since guys say it's the hottest ruckus you can make on the mattress, start off with a purr or an mmmm, or simply breathe heavily. Cha-ching! Your beau will be burning up. "This kind of feedback cheers him on," says Zoldbrod. Plus, a few easy oohs and ahhs will help you get comfortable.

If that got you going and totally gunned his motor, attempt some dialogue. "You can take any old sentence and say it sexily," says Zoldbrod. "Just whispering or emphasizing certain words will up the erotic ante." For example, "What do you want to do now?" can be said as a breathy "So...what do you want to do now?" Or a little murmuring and accentuation of key words will fire up phrases like "You have the most amazing hands"

and "I love it when you do that.

If your cutie took to the compliments by issuing his own or was clearly excited by your semispicy discourse, then maybe you want to get a little dirtier. To avoid embarrassment and clichéd phrases spawned during the days of Boogie Nights: "Develop your own code for those words that are difficult to say and you'll feel less Pg 242





tongue-tied," says Zoldbrod. "Can we do my favorite thing?" might signify 69; "tease me" could be a request for oral sex; and "my turn" might let him know that you want to be on top.

Sex Texts to Entice Him

Want to turn him on in 10 words or less? These naughty e-notes will do it.

 I was a BAD GIRL and spent my lunch hour shopping. You can spank me later.

 Got a new showerhead-the detachable kind. The pressure's awesome.

 There's a VIP-only party @ [fill in your address here] 2nite.

 TDTM (translation: text dirty to me)

 Don't do much @ the gym...save energy for L8R.

 Ur picturing me (a) naked, (b) in a Jacuzzi, (c) both

 Was in such a rush! 4got 2 wear a bra.

 Can I bring anything 4 our d8? Wine? Chocolate sauce?

 I'm in dressing room @ the mall...in a thong.

 Ur ass looks gr8 in those jeans.

 I'll pole dance 4 you. U bring the pole...

 Found my old cheerleading uniform. Still fits.

 Splurged at Victoria's Secret. A girl can't have too many lacy panties, can she?

 No movies out I want to see. Other ideas for what we can do in the dark?

Q&A How can I talk dirty and still stay focused?

Q: My boyfriend has a hard time climaxing unless I talk dirty during sex. The only problem is that I end up concentrating so much on what to say, I can't stay focused on enjoying the experience. How can I do both?

You won't be so distracted if you verbalize what's going on at the moment. Instead of getting hung up trying to sound like a porn star or come up with some erotic fantasy, just tell your man what you're thinking or feeling.

For example, if you're caressing him all over, say something like, "I love the way your hard-on feels in my hands." Or, whisper in his ear what you're going to do to him next. The anticipation of what's about to happen will work him into a frenzy. You can also voice your own requests. Guys want to please their partners in bed, and they appreciate any direction they can get. So, don't be shy about asking for what you want. And, when his touches send waves of excitement through your bod, praise his technique. Saying, "You're making me so hot and wet" or "You're driving me wild!" will boost his ego...and his arousal. And pretty soon you'll both be uttering the ultimate frisky phrase: "I'm coming!" A line that's so simple, yet so sexy.

How do I have phone sex?

Q: My boyfriend and I have a long-distance relationship. To tide us over between visits, he really wants to have phone sex. I have no idea what to say, and I always feel foolish. Any advice?

Phone sex is the perfect way to make a carnal connection when you and your man are apart. And while the thought of it may leave you speechless, tantalizing talk isn't as tricky as you think. Just use your erotic imagination. Share your steamy desires, describe details from your favourite fantasy or tell him, step-by-step, what you wish you were doing to him.

Remember, aural sex isn't all talk and no action. Up the erotic ante by simultaneously masturbating. Explain to each other exactly what you're doing ("I'm tracing circles on my inner thigh") and how it's feeling ("I'm getting so wet"). He'll go nuts. Giving good phone is a lot easier -- and more fun -- if you get into a lusty mood before Pg 243

you dial his digits. Lie back and envision a supercharged bedroom scenario with your guy. Start stroking yourself, and when your pulse is pounding, give him a call.

Since this is your first time starting sexy phone speak, you might be a little tongue-tied. But don't feel forced to say something XXX-rated. Just chat with him as you normally would and ease into a more intimate exchange by saying something as simple as "I wish you were lying next to me." Or lift his libido by reminding him of an incredibly hot sack session you had together. You're guaranteed to get a rise out of him.

If you aren't comfortable initiating a kinky conversation, suggest your boyfriend take the lead. Close your eyes and concentrate on every wanton word. As you touch yourself, fantasize that you're feeling his tantalizing fingers caressing your skin. If at first you feel shy, just moan or sigh while he narrates a naughty story. As the encounter escalates, you may be very surprised at the frisky phrases that pop out of your mouth.
